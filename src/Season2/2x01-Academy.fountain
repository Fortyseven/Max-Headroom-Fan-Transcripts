>*20 MINUTES INTO THE FUTURE...*<

EST. THE FRINGES - DAY

Establishing shot of people living in the fringes. Poor people, outcasts of society, warming themselves by the fire.

We pan over to reveal the unmistakable PINK BUS of _Big Time Television_.

CUT TO:

INT. BIGTIME TELEVISION BUS
Opens on a close up of a TV showing a radical music video for a cover of "Summertime Blues", including clips from "Jac Mac & Rad Boy Go!". [[NOTE: In the original script this was intended to be Blue Cheer's Summertime Blues (1968). I've searched exhaustively for the version used here, and there are nearly an infinite amount of covers out there. Odds are this was taking the Knight Rider route of just covering a tune in-house.]]


    >~ ♪ Sometimes I wonder what I'm a-gonna do / There ain't no cure for the summertime blues... ♪<

We pull back to see BLANK REG rocking out to the music, with his dog FANG faithfully by his side.

BLANK REG
THIS! IS! BLANK! REG!
*YEEEEAAAAH!*

The music is rudely interrupting DOMINIQUE's own session in front of a TV sceen.

DOMINIQUE
Reg.

Reg doesn't hear her over the insane volume of the music.

DOMINIQUE
Reg!

Fed up, and realizing he can't hear her over the racket, Dominique marches over to him and turns the volume down.

BLANK REG
Dom, if it's not loud, it doesn't _work_!

Dom grabs a pair of HEADPHONES and plants them (carefully, but forcefully) around Reg's mohawk-clad skull.

The music can still be heard through the headphones, but is considerably more bearable as Dom returns to her show.

The too-tanned, big-haired blonde TV HOST of _Shoppin' Spree_, a network shopping channel, grins predatorily at her audience. Numerous warnings and various calls-to-action flash across the borders of the screen. *"CALL NOW!"*, *"LIMITED TIME OFFER"*, etc.

TV HOST
Are you tired of complaints about sagging buns? Or flat and naughty little muffins? Then this next product is just for you!

Dom perks up at this.

TV HOST
(cont'd)
And our first 23 callers will receive, absolutely free, this beautiful diamond necklace!

Dom, visibly delighted at this "free" bonus, gingerly inserts her CREDIT-TUBE into a low profile payment DEVICE in front of the TV, and punches in what is presumably a pin-code.

BLANK REG
I don't know how you can watch that drivel.

DOMINIQUE
(unfazed by Reg's criticism)
One of my little pleasures. Makes me happy.

TV HOST
If you want the real thing for the right stuff, *Zik-Zak Muffin* is it! And the packaging is perfect as a soiree purse!

With a flash of TV static, the giggling visage of AI talking head, MAX HEADROOM, pops onto her screen.

[[NOTE: this is called "Zik-Zak Soy Muffins" elsewhere]]

MAX
You know, this home shop-shop-shopping show is great.

Dom half-smirks at Max, mockingly, knowing what's coming.

MAX
(cont'd)
From start to finish, it's just sell, sell, sell, sell, sell, sell. At last - HA! - a show with no-no-no commercials!


DOMINIQUE
(angry)
GO AWAY!

Max vanishes from her screen in a puff of snow.

DOMINIQUE
Reg, Max is ruining my program.

BLANK REG
(still watching videos, cupping hand to headphone)
Good!

Dom looks back at the TV screen, which has since reverted to the home shopping show.

DOMINIQUE
Honestly, someone at Network 23 ought to do something about him.

Suddenly her TV show is interrupted yet again. This time it's not Max. It's something... *else*.

DOMINIQUE
Reg... Reg, come here.

Weird faces and cartoon sound effects flash across the screen like a blipvert. _I'M THE KRACKER_, _Z I P P I N G_, and _1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0_ are briefly visible in-between the audiovisual insanity.

BLANK REG
Reg!

Dom gets up and RIPS the headphones from his head. Reg yelps.

BLANK REG
Ow! Bleeding hell, Dom. Nearly ripped me bleeding ears off!

DOMINIQUE
(urgent)
Come here!

BLANK REG
(grumpy, resigned)
Blimey, what is it?

DOMINIQUE
Look.

Dom gestures towards the chaos on the screen.

BLANK REG
Well, that's not Max, Dom.

*(beat as Reg takes it in)*

BLANK REG
(realizing)
It's those 'zippers' again! They must have a *hell* of a setup. Zipping into network transmissions takes a lot of power.


DOMINIQUE
Well, they're *ruining* my shopping.

BLANK REG
(clearly admiring)
Takes a lot of *nerve* as well.

CUT TO:

INT. NETWORK 23 BOARD ROOM
Inside the dark black void that is the Network 23 board room, it's members -- including LAUREN, ASHWELL, EDWARDS, and Network 23 president CHEVIOT -- sit across from each other around the large board room table, reviewing footage of the 'zipping' incident.

We see the same footage Reg and Dom saw previously, but projected on the MASSIVE TELEVISION on the board room wall.

LAUREN
How are they doing this?

ASHWELL
(quick to jump in)
Well, you see, they hack into our satellite transponders and they hijack our frequency.

CHEVIOT
(annoyed)
Ashwell. Lauren means, "how are they cracking our security?"

ASHWELL
Oh.

EDWARDS
(hard, on a mission)
They flatten our ratings every time they zip us like that. Look at those figures.

Edwards pushes a button and an animated graphical readout appears on the big screen, and everyone looks.

A horizontal line graph appears on the screen showing real-time ratings of various competing networks. Each flickers up and down erratically, but Network 23 is clearly taking a hit.

The panic in the room increases inversely.

EDWARDS
(cont'd, off screen)
_Shoppin' Spree TV_ is *diving*.


EDWARDS
(cont'd, pointing finger agressively)
Viewers won't stand for this!

ASHWELL
This has got to be stopped!

LAUREN
This is dangerous... If they can break into our carrier that easily, nothing's safe.

ASHWELL
(not seeing the big picture)
Our bank accounts, our medical records...

Edwards calls out the elephant in the room.

EDWARDS
(getting to the point, glancing from Ashwell to Cheviot)
Never mind that. What about _ratings_?

CHEVIOT
I've already alerted Bryce Lynch. He's been trying to track them for some time. He was a hacker himself, you know. Send a thief to catch a thief.

While Cheviot is talking, a secretary off-screen announces his call is ready.

SECRETARY
(o.c.)
Bryce is on view-phone, Mr. Cheviot.

CHEVIOT
Ah, Bryce.

Wide shot of the board room as we see the face of BRYCE LYNCH, boy genius, fill the big screen. The board members all turn their gaze to him.

CHEVIOT
(cont'd)
You get that last zipping?

BRYCE
(mildly irritated)
Of course. I've isolated the satellite they're hacking into. Now, it wasn't easy, because they hacked our security...

CHEVIOT
(pushing through Bryce's boasting)
Bryce, just the conclusion will be fine.

BRYCE
(still irked, now at his intelligence being brushed off)
The *conclusion*, Mr. Cheviot, is that they are extremely good. But not as good as I am, naturally.

The board members shuffle uncomfortably in their seats.

BRYCE
(o.c.)
Would you like to watch my endgame?

LAUREN
(sotto)
He thinks this is a game.

CHEVIOT
(sotto)
He thinks everything's a game.

CHEVIOT
(cont'd, his gaze turning to the screen)
Don't you, Bryce?

BRYCE
Yes. I often play chess with the 23 computer. And I often beat it.

A beep emanates from Bryce's terminal.

BRYCE
Ah, here we go. Would you like to watch?

Edwards looks especially uncomfortable.

Bryce transfers his display to their big screen so they can see it all happening.

A _Security Systems_ global security display appears, showing Bryce tracking down the source of the zipping, directing Metrocops where to go. Bryce's keyboard CLACKING in the background provides an aural backdrop.

Cheviot watches as the Bryce works his magic.

Suddenly the map begins to close in to street level. Blips on the map flash. Cheviot gets visibly excited.

CHEVIOT
You've got it! Well done, Bryce.

CUT TO:
INT. BRYCE'S LAB
Bryce is reviewing a printout. His confidence drops. He's concerned.

BRYCE
(to o.c. Cheviot)
Uh, I think there's a little error. Can you hang on just one minute?

Cheviot and the board look back and forth at each other, concerned... and a bit confused.

Meanwhile, Bryce is thinking hard, furiously hacking away at his keyboard. A graphic appears showing *something*, but we're not entirely sure what it is.

Finally...

CUT BACK TO:
INT. NETWORK 23 BOARD ROOM

BRYCE
There's your target. That's it, Mr. Cheviot. You've got your zipper.

Cheviot, quite pleased, picks up his telephone receiver.

CHEVIOT
Let me have security.

CUT TO:
INT. BRYCE'S LAB
Bryce smiles, feeling good about his quick thinking.

CUT TO:
EXT. THE FRINGES, BIG-TIME BUS - DAY

BLANK REG
(o.c., on air)
You're tuned to *Big-Time Television*. Where music is the brandy of the damned... so, let's pop the cork on this!

Metrocop vans swarm the area, and officers pile out of them.

They've come for Reg.

METROCOP
(background)
Go, go, go!

CUT TO:
EST. CITY/FRINGES NETWORK 23 SKYLINE - DUSK

CUT TO:
INT. NETWORK 23 CONTROL ROOM
Edison Carter swaggers into Control, huge video camera at his hip.

THEORA
(to a view-phone, at her desk)
Hold on, Dominique, he just walked in.

EDISON
(to Theora, conversationally)
You see what that explosion did to the people in that city, you'll know why they call it a "breeder reactor".

THEORA
(ignoring what he said)
Edison, it's Dominique. Blank Reg has been arrested.

EDISON
(beat, looks at the view-phone)
What happened?

DOMINIQUE
Metrocops. They said he was "signal zipping".

EDISON
(shocked)
Reg? That's crazy. That's way out of his league.

DOMINIQUE
Reg asked me to call you. Edison, you've got to help him.

EDISON
Where are they holding him?

DOMINIQUE
Metro Jail 42.

Edison jots it down in his notepad.

EDISON
I'm on my way.

CUT TO:

EXT. METROJAIL 42 - DAY
We truck past a Metrocop van as the back door opens in front of "Metro Jail 42". Blank Reg, "Metrocop" branded sack over his head and torso, is pulled out of the back by a pair of cops.

The cops lead him inside.

METROCOP
Let's go.

CUT TO:
INT. METROJAIL 42
A half-dozen citizens are in a smoky, poorly lit waiting room. A pair of cops watching everything.

We follow a man and woman as they enter, and approach a view-phone terminal with a credit tube hole.

COMPUTER
(o.c.)
Insert credit tube.

The woman inserts her credit tube, and the machine beeps approvingly. The view-screen comes to life as the prisoner they're visiting appears on the screen. An impersonal, and more importantly, profitable way for people to visit prisoners in jail.

We don't hear their conversation; instead we truck right to the next booth where a female attorney is talking to her client on the view-screen.

ATTY. KEELER
Now, just tell me the truth. Were you zipping into Network 23 transmissions from Big-Time?

BLANK REG
Do me a favor, girl. There's not enough power in that bus to zip up me trousers, never mind a network satellite.

ATTY. KEELER
I don't think you understand the severity of this charge. Network zipping is a prime offense. Sir --

BLANK REG
(boiling)
I understand one thing, darling: someone's trying to frame me. And when I find who, I'm gonna unilaterally *murder* the swine.

At this, a box in the background of Reg's room begins sounding a brief, but frantic alarm.

ATTY. KEELER
Watch your threats! We are being monitored.

Reg blows this off, not caring.

ATTY. KEELER
(cont'd)
Now, we might have a chance, as long as you aren't a recidivist.

BLANK REG
Me? No way. I can't even spell it.

ATTY. KEELER
(surprised)
You don't have a criminal profile?

BLANK REG
That's right. Of course I don't.

Edison arrives, visible to the view-screen.

BLANK REG
(desperately)
Edison! You've got to get me out of this! Someone is setting me up. Right up.

A BONG noise sounds, and a computer-like voice begins an announcement.

COMPUTER
All rise for the most highly rated judge.

A door labeled "CHAMBERS" creaks open, and a TV view-screen cart is rolled out by two Metrocops.

JUDGE
Please approach the bench.

The prosecution and the defense (Reg's attorney) insert their floppy disks into the front of the view-screen, each causing a BUZZING acceptance in resposne.

PROSECUTION
Your honor, the network has reason to believe that an indictment of first-degree zipping should be brought against this defendant.

JUDGE
(pointing to Reg's attorney)
Counsel for the defense.

ATTY. KEELER
I move for dismissal on the grounds that the network has no first-hand corroboration that my client committed this crime.

PROSECUTION
He's a Blank, your honor.

Keeler looks in horror that her associate would bring that up.

JUDGE
(concerned)
A Blank? In that case, he's beyond my jurisprudence...
(beat)
Video Court!

ATTY. KEELER
But you haven't evaluated my floppy disc!

The Judge slams his gavel down hard.

JUDGE
The charges stand.

The Metrocops roll the view-screen cart away. Meanwhile, another Metrocop rolls over a comically large, board game-like spinner with days of the week printed on it.

ATTY. KEELER
We've got to pick a court date.

ATTY. KEELER
(to Edison)
Would you care to do the honors?

EDISON
(weary at the absurdity of it all)
No thanks. All yours.

The attorney turns to the wheel and gives the spinner a big turn. Around and around it goes, finally landing on "Wednesday".

BLANK REG
(wistfully)
I play *Grateful Dead* on Wednesdays...

ATTY. KEELER
(exasperated)
It only gives me one day to prepare your defense.

The attorney walks away, getting to work.

BLANK REG
(to Edison)
You believe me, don't you, old son?

Edison looks at Reg, going into full on "supportive" mode.

EDISON
Yeah. You didn't. You couldn't. And you wouldn't!

EDISON
(cont'd, contemplative)
Question is, who did?

Reg quietly shakes his head; he has no idea, either.

CUT TO:
EST. NETWORK 23 TOWER - NIGHT

CUT TO:
INT. NETWORK 23 CONTROL ROOM - THEORA'S DESK - NIGHT
Edison walks in, headed for Theora's desk.

THEORA
How's Reg?

EDISON
He's pretty angry, all right.

EDISON
(cont'd, leaning in on her screen)
What do ya' got?

We see the same video graphics from the Board Room raid scene on Theora's display.

THEORA
Well, Bryce coordinated the targeting for that raid. It seems he had a problem and it switched from mid-set, which is very strange.

EDISON
Can it be switched?

THEORA
Yeah, it could, but, uh, why?

THEORA
(cont'd)
Okay, the sat cam program produces a lot of temporary files. Then discards them.

Her display shifts to a visual representation of files being moved into the PURGE DIRECTORY.

THEORA
All those bits and pieces go into the purge directory, which is a sort of an electronic trash bin.

EDISON
(following)
Mm-hmm.

THEORA
(cont'd)
Which the systems operator empties at the end of the day. Everything ends up in there. Discarded files, bits and pieces of video outtakes, messages. I'll see what I can find.

CUT TO:

INT. BRYCE'S LAB - NIGHT
Bryce sits with his hands arched in front of his face, deep in thought. Max, on a monitor in the background, observes him.

MAX
Praying, Bryce?

BRYCE
No.

MAX
(wistfully)
No need, huh?

BRYCE
No.

MAX
Oh, good. Oh, good.

MAX
(cont'd)
Game of chess?

BRYCE
No thanks, Max.

MAX
(persistent)
You can be white.

BRYCE
(vexxed)
No thanks, Max. Really. I'm thinking. I'm evaluating a recent strategy.

MAX
I know.

MAX
Did it work?

BRYCE
(surprised)
What?!

MAX
(in on it)
Switching the coordinates.

BRYCE
How on earth did you know?

MAX
I happened to be flit-flit-flitting about the mainframe and I just watched the show.

BRYCE
You won't tell... will you?

Max huffs in a way where he seems indecisive; we're not sure what he'll do. Probably not.

CUT TO:

INT. NETWORK 23 CONTROL ROOM - THEORA'S DESK - NIGHT
Theora and Edison are still poured over her monitor.

THEORA
These files write over themselves a lot before they're thrown away. I'll get the computer to extrapolate it for us.

Theora punches some keys. The graphic on her display changes to a globe that slowly contracts it's view, closer and closer. [[NOTE: The episode seems to zoom in on somewhere near Indiana, but in true Max Headroom fashion this will never be canonical.]]

THEORA
Now, those are the coordinates of the target. But look, they switch and give us another set.

EDISON
What are the new coordinates?

Theora reaches over, pulling a fresh readout from the line printer behind them.

THEORA
(reading)
Big-Time Television...

EDISON
What are the original coordinates? I'm beginning to get a very nasty tingle in my spine.

MURRAY
(listening in, o.c.)
Well, that's good. Probably means a story.

Murray walks in, all business.

THEORA
(irritated)
It's not nice to eavesdrop, Murray.

MURRAY
It's not nice to falsify evidence, either. Let's have the coordinates.

THEORA
My god, it's ACS. *(beat)* The Academy of Computer Sciences.

MURRAY
Now, that is a story.

EDISON
(sarcastically)
Network 23's computer wiz kids zipping their own channel? That's a story, all right.

MURRAY
(conceding)
Yeah, I get your point. A bit, uhm... sensitive.

EDISON
Sensitive? You can say that again.

MURRAY
All right. Uh, go to ACS. Lay some story on them, see just what's going on.

MAN
(o.c.)
Murray, Bryce Lynch on line two.

MURRAY
Yeah.

EDISON
Theora.

THEORA
It'll be fun, Edison! Like going back to school.

EDISON
(knowing)
Theora...

THEORA
What?

EDISON
We both know something else about ACS, don't we?

THEORA
(resigned)
Yes, we do. It's where Bryce came from.

EDISON
We got a problem...

Murray rushes back.

MURRAY
Listen, I have a great idea. I just told Bryce to go with you. You see, he'll be able to talk to the kids, help you subvert the little geniuses.

Murray notices *something* is up.

MURRAY
What's the matter?

*(beat)*

MURRAY
(insistently)
_What is the matter?_

Edison and Theora look around uncomfortably.

CUT TO:

INT. BRYCE'S LAB

MAX
Welllll?

BRYCE
Well what?

MAX
Well, as they said to K-K-King Charles I on the scaffold, are you going to go quietly? Or do you need a push?

Bryce sits down, DRINK in hand.

BRYCE
To ACS?
(scoffs)
Murray asked me to. I have to help Edison. What could I say? I have no choice.

MAX
Of course you have a choice-ce-ce. The same one Charles I had.

BRYCE
Exactly.

Bryce guzzles down his drink.

BRYCE
Will you come with me?
(beat)
 I think I have a problem...

The boy genius begins typing a message on his terminal as Max overlooks, and we dolly in to see: _ACS STUDENT GUARD_: _THE SPORE IS IN THE WIND._
[[NOTE: You can make out a crew member's shoulder in the bottom-right reflection as we get closer.]]


>**End of Act I**<

===

>**Act II**<
EXT. ACADEMY OF COMPUTER SCIENCES - DAY
We see students with backpacks and schoolbooks walking up the steps of the *Academy of Computer Sciences*.

A calm, almost HAL-9000-like P.A. annoucement plays in the background.

ANNOUNCER
(o.c.)
Academy of Computer Sciences fourth period pod begins in exactly 1 minute and 3.0 seconds.

CUT TO:
INT. ACADEMY OF COMPUTER SCIENCES CLASSROOM - DAY
Another disembodied voice, a computerized teacher perhaps (?), doles out instructions to some of ACS's brightest students.
[[NOTE: I have no idea what "Logical Proportion 22" means, but it's on the wall in the final version, I'm noting it here for completeness.]]

ANOTHER ANNOUNCER
(o.c. over PA)
Your assignment for this period is to compute ten designs for peizo-polymer fingers of a surgical robot hand. Also, please note that we have distinguished visitors from Network 23 today. So please show them how courteous we are.

One boy in particuar (Nicholas Stratton) looks over his shoulder as he sees Edison and Bryce wheeling in equipment.

NICHOLAS
(to girl next to him, cryptically)
"The spore is loaded." You take the first watch.

The girl nods.

CUT TO:
INT. ACADEMY OF COMPUTER SCIENCES HALLWAY - CONT'D

Bryce points at the wall.

BRYCE
Look here, that's me.

Edison and Bryce are both hunched over, closely examining the wall of historical photos. There's almost a slight hint of bonding between them here.

EDISON
(stupefied)
Oh, yeah. You trying to tell me you had sideburns?

BRYCE
(almost offended)
Yeah.

EDISON
This bring back memories?

The two continue down the hallway, Bryce lugging his equipment on a dolly; Edison, his camera.

BRYCE
Some. Most memories are the random retrieval of normally superfluous data. A waste of "real-time". I try to bulk erase mine daily.

EDISON
(unimpressed)
Yeah, well, be careful you don't erase all the bits that add up to experience.

BRYCE
(quickly, fronting)
Oh, I keep the critical material!
(reminiscing)
I remember my first undergraduate day here. It was Tuesday. It was raining, and I was cold.

EDISON
Huh. Your random recall is almost as good as Max's.

BRYCE
Oh, that's not random. That was my tenth birthday.

Ba-dump dump. Edison considers him for a moment as they go separate ways.

CUT TO:
INT. NETWORK 23 CONTROL ROOM - THEORA'S DESK - DAY
Theora and Murray are lurched over her terminal as she navigates the securicam network of ACS.

THEORA
They've separated. These kids are bright. They're into securicams everywhere. I mean, I'm tapping off *their* illicit feeds.

MURRAY
Which makes you even brighter.

THEORA
Older.

MURRAY
(insistent)
Wiser!

THEORA
(mock swooning)
Marry me, Murray.

For a beat Murray almost considers it, but then just grins.

CUT TO:
INT. ACS HALLWAY - CONT'D
Students roam the halls, going between their classes, as Edison makes his way through against the flow.

ANNOUNCER
(o.c.)
Announcement. Nanotechnology pod test results are posted in the sub-micron lab for your viewing.

Edison stops just short of a large door that says _SIDNEY HARDING, HEADSYSOP_.

He picks up a huge 8" floppy disk off a nearby table. He considers it for a moment, and stashes it in his inventory.

EDISON
(mockingly to himself)
"Headsysop."
(beat)
Does it teach, or devour maidens?

Carter takes a breath, steels himself, and then knocks on the door.

CUT TO:
INT. DIFFERENT ACS HALLWAY - CONT'D
Bryce slowly travels the halls with his heavy equipment dolly. He looks around at the students, lost in thought. He even bumps into one accidentally.

ANNOUNCER
Announcement. Students are reminded not to leave their mutated molecules in their lockers overnight.

CUT TO:
INT. ACS STARWELL - CONT'D

The dolly comes to a stop in front of an UNMARKED UTILITY DOOR. Bryce pushes on the bar and the door opens, revealing STAIRS going down.

He goes down one or two steps, but then stops, turns around, and examines a SECRET PANEL under the railing.

Opening it, inside, he discovers two RED WIRES are exposed, seemingly cut.

Confused, Bryce exists and returns to his dolly.

CUT TO:
INT. DIFFERENT ACS HALLWAY - CONT'D
Bryce looks around, still confused. But then continues down the hallway.
[[TODO: come back to this later]]

As he makes his way, a marble bust creeiply rotates on it's pedistal, like something out of *The Prisoner*, observing Bryce through the security camera in it's eye.
[[NOTE: This is comically large in the final episode.]]

J-CUT TO:

INT. HEADSYSOP'S OFFICE - CONT'D
...pushing in through a window into the lavishly furnished office of the Headsysop. Inside, we see Edison sitting across from the Headsysop's DESK, mid-discussion about the zipping situation.

The headsysop chomps on a PIPE as he listens.

EDISON
Well, we haven't got any absolute proof. But the signals were tracked to this campus. Naturally, I'm more inquisitive than anything else.

HEADSYSOP
Naturally.
(beat)
Are you positive about this?

EDISON
One of your former students did the tracking. Bryce Lynch. And he claims to be a genius, so...

HEADSYSOP
Ah, Lynch.
(remembers)
Excellent student. Single-minded. Well, ACS students don't make mistakes, and Lynch was one of the very best.
(pause)
In his time, of course.

The Headsysop pauses a bit longer as he takes a big drag off his pipe. The memories come flooding back.


HEADSYSOP
Odd boy.
(beat)
He never made contact with his parents after he came to us.
(dismissively)
They were, uhm... *middle management*, you know.
(another beat)
I well remember...

An alarm chirps, interrupting him.

HEADSYSOP
(checking the time)
Time for my 3:00 pod.
(beat)
I'll bring this up after session. I'm as anxious as you to get to the bottom of it.

As the Headmaster gathers his things, including a small wooden CROP, They both stand...

EDISON
Headsysops, pods. Tell you, in my day, it was headmasters and classes.

HEADSYSOP
(thoughtfully)
Yes, yes. How times change... We're all input systems, operators, and pod managers now, my boy.

The both share a polite, yet sensible chuckle and head for the door.

On the way out, the Headsysop smacks Edison on the ass playfully, with his crop, surprising both Edison, and us. As he does this, he adds...

HEADSYSOP
(spirited chuckling)
But you can't fool an old head, you know!

CUT TO:

INT. C.U ACS AUDITORIUM STAGE - CONT'D
A childish, electro-mechanical, antenna-clad silver rat scoots and squeaks across the stage, towards the camera.


HEADSYSOP
Settle down, settle down. Order from chaos.

CUT TO:
INT. ACS AUDITORIUM - CONT'D
The Headsysop stands on stage, addressing the audience composed of ACS students. Edison is there, too, not too far away.

The mic occasionally threatens to pierce our ears with feedback, but it never does.

He produces a plastic bag, and describes it's contents to the students.

HEADSYSOP
And now, for your next project, you will each receive a package containing one floppy diskette, an old-fashioned 888 processor, and a coat hanger.
(beat)
With these materials, you will be expected to design a device to snare Clifford here.

He gestures at the mechanical rat.

HEADSYSOP
We'll see which one of you can build the better mousetrap.

PARTRIDGE
(arrogantly)
Piece of cake.

NICHOLAS
Piece of *cheese*.

PARTRIDGE
Your humor parameters need expanding, Nicholas.

Nicholas raises his hand, eager with a question.

HEADSYSOP
Yes, Stratton?

NICHOLAS
Can we kill it?

HEADSYSOP
(surprised, by unfazed)
Yes, that is within the bounds of the experiment. But I'm afraid you'll find that more difficult than you imagine.

The girl also raises her hand, with a follow-up question.

HEADSYSOP
Uh, Miss Partridge?

PARTRIDGE
What are the time parameters here?

HEADSYSOP
You may have until the end of the day.
(beat)
If there are no further questions...

The boy once again raises his hand.

HEADSYSOP
(mild irritation)
Yes, Stratton?

NICHOLAS
What's Edison Carter doing here?

HEADSYSOP
Oh, once again my little code crunchers are getting ahead of their old sysop.
(amused)
Say hello to Mr. Edison Carter.


>(all the kids, together)<
>🎵 *Hello, Mr. Carter!* 🎵<

PARTRIDGE
(to Nicholas)
He *does* look like Max Headroom!

EDISON
(putting on a slightly muted Max Headroom impression that threatens to obliterate the fourth wall)
Uh, no, actually. *He* looks like *me*.

Both Nicholas and Partridge giggle at this.

HEADSYSOP
Mr. Carter brings a disturbing piece of information. He suspects some highly illegal signal zipping has been emanating from this campus. Now, if this is true, I expect the responsible party to report to my office.
(beat)
Because you are all minors, you will be spared the particular punishment usually afforded adults.
(another beat)
As I am fond of saying, we have our own methods... Pod dismissed.

The kids, freed, scramble out of their seats, making way for the exit. Edison, too, stands but heads in the opposite direction to meet up with the Headsysop.

They walk and talk slowly toward the exit.

EDISON
They seem like a normal bunch of kids.

HEADSYSOP
Oh, yes.

EDISON
(faux-sotto)
Homicidal rodent squishers.

The Headmaster chuckles.

EDISON
(cont'd)
You really expect the guilty party just to march right into your office?

HEADSYSOP
Of course. We instill the morality of binary absolutes here, Mr. Carter. The useful consequence of pure logic is the divine simplicity of a yes/no decision about everything.

EDISON
Well, what about right and wrong? I notice you said "responsible party," not "guilty"--

HEADSYSOP
(cutting him off)
A *gray area* is quite useless to a computer specialist. We don't deal in guilt. We deal in information. That is why the appropriate party will be with us shortly. You'll see.
(gesturing towards the exit)
Let's adjourn to my office.

CUT TO:
INT. ACADEMY OF COMPUTER SCIENCES CLASSROOM - CONT'D
Bryce has unpacked the equipment from his dolly onto a STUDENT'S DESK in an empty classroom. We open in close-up on Bryce as he's lurched over a pile of components with a pair of PLIERS.

Max, already up and running on the monitor in front of him, strikes up a conversation.

MAX
Ahh! Doesn't this place bring back f-f-fond memories, Bryce? Ah-Ah-Ah, the sounds, the s-s-squeak of trainers on the gym floor, the screech of ch-chalk on gallium chip. The secret kissssss behind the computer terminal.

BRYCE
It wasn't like that. Why do people get so sentimental about college days?

MAX
Because for p-p-people like Edison, it was a time of giggles, g-g-girls, guys, and g-g-getting into trouble.

BRYCE
Not me.

MAX
Not yet!

The door to the classroom opens, drawing both Max and Bryce's attention.

STUDENT
Bryce Lynch is in there.


In walk Nicholas and Partridge and a third student (the one who just said that?)



NICHOLAS
Well. It's Bryce Lynch.

Both Nicholas and Bryce begin performing a ridiculous secret hand gesture in the form of a binary series of ☝ and 👌 gestures forming _1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0__.

Nicholas does this flawlessly.

Bryce gets most of the way and gives up.

It's good enough.


NICHOLAS
We got the warning.

BRYCE
Good. How's your security?

NICHOLAS
Optimized. Only the inner circle knows.
(looking closer at the screen next to Bryce)
What's that?

BRYCE
My computer regeneration project: "Max Headroom".

NICHOLAS
Ah, yes. We've heard about that.
(arrogantly)
Rather primitive.

Max is visibly offended, but says nothing.

NICHOLAS
(cont'd, boasting)
We're into *cross-species* regeneration these days.
(cranking up the boast-o-meter)
A little more *advanced*.

The students, having delivered their dis, all but drop the mic as they make for the exit.

Never meet your heroes, I guess.


MAX
(to Bryce)
Se-Se-Se-*Seems* like a nice boy.

BRYCE
Nicholas rather enjoys his performances.

MAX
Talk-Talk-Talking of performances, if you're gonna get us out of this m-m-mess you got us into, you'll need some fancy dancing.

Bryce just returns to his work.

CUT TO:

INT. HEADSYSOP'S OFFICE - CONT'D
An old style clock ticks away in silence as the Headsysop and Edison sit across from each other in silence.

The Headsysop cleans his pipe with a rag, and breaks the silence.

HEADSYSOP
What puzzles me is how a former student could have been incorrect about ACS being the source of the zipping.

EDISON
Bryce wasn't wrong. The party who did it just isn't 'fessing up.

HEADSYSOP
(dismissive)
Logically impure. It would assume that there is a guilty party.
(beat)
It just doesn't compute. It would imply a gray area. Not at ACS, Mr. Carter. We work with perfect information.

The Headsysop clearly believes his own bullshit.

EDISON
(weak smile)
Paradise, huh?
(beat)
Well, maybe you got a dragon in the Garden of Eden.

Edison bolts up out of the comfy chair.

EDISON
You mind if I have a look around on my own?

HEADSYSOP
No, no, not at all. But, Mr. Carter...
(beat, chuckling)
...beware the dragon!

CUT TO:

INT. METROJAIL 42 - CONT'D
Back at the Metrojail, Dom is updating Reg. His fills the prison's visitor view-screen.

BLANK REG
How's Fang?

DOMINIQUE
Off his food.

BLANK REG
Blimey, that bad? Now, be sure he gets his ice cream every night.

DOMINIQUE
(raising her voice)
Yes, I will, but he won't eat it out of your spoon for me.
(beat, sadder)
And Big-Time is off-air...  we could go out of business.


Everything is just a cloud of misery for the Big Time Television couple.

BLANK REG
(almost stunned, monotone)
...he likes 'chocolate chip' best...

...off her incredulous eye-roll, we

CUT TO:

INT. NETWORK 23 CONTROL ROOM - THEORA'S DESK - CONT'D
Once again, Murray and Theora are hunched over the terminal on her desk.

On her monitor we see her exploring the network securi-cams across ACS. She stops at one that shows Edison in the distance coming towards the direction of the camera.

She zooms in. Edison talking to her through the camera (presumably the audio is coming through Edison's camera...?)

EDISON
(talking to her over his camera link, but she can see him 'live')
If they *are* zipping, Theora, they're very clever at hiding it. Apart from the inside of locker doors, whole place is clean.

THEORA
Oh, no, it isn't, Edison. That hardware they've got in there is fully capable of signal zipping.
(typing, exploring other cameras)
Look!

Theora's display flips to another security camera the students control -- this one monitors the Headsysop's office from a high angle.

The Headsysop has clearly fallen asleep at the desk.

MURRAY
(amused)
Crafty little devils.

THEORA
That's nothing to the rest of the setup.


Her display changes moves to yet another camera. This time, it shows the student's lavatory with a half-dozen kids secretly smoking.

THEORA
(amused)
Some have perverted little minds.

She types some more, the next feed showing Bryce looking suspicious as he walks the hallways of ACS.

THEORA
Oh, good, there's Bryce.

In the footage on the display, we see Bryce stop in front of another marble BUST. This time, he grabs the nose, flipping it up like a cell phone cover, and presses a button.

The statue begins *talking* with a student's voice; a speaker hidden somewhere on it.

Theora and Murray listen in, intently.

STATUE
Nice to see you accessing the old memory bank, sir.

BRYCE
Turn down the potentiometer before you close the mic. I've come to say goodbye. We're about finished here. Are your mics security looped?

STATUE
Of course.

BRYCE
Good.

Bryce steps away for a sec, making sure no one's around, and then he continues...

BRYCE
(cont'd)
Congratulations. We got away with it. The only thing that can happen to Blank Reg now is some temporary discomfort. They'll soon find out he hasn't the power to zip and... justice will compute.


He looks around again, quickly.

BRYCE
Eventually.

THEORA
(disgusted)
You little *beast*.

MURRAY
Bryce. I don't believe it.

THEORA
Lots of little girls' and boys' tricks in the system.

Edison has been listening in the whole time.

EDISON
(over the link, dripping with innuendo)
What kind of games did you play, Theora?

THEORA
(flirting)
Growing up games.
(smirks)
Doctors and nurses.

Murray looks at her in a wordless "oh really" kind of way.

EDISON
Yeah, well, there's nothing like a *good physical*.

We cut to Securicam footage of Edison in a random ACS hallway as Theora gives him real-time directions.

THEORA
Okay, turn left and go straight ahead until you reach the stairwell.

LINE
Learn anything that might brighten my day?

LINE
Yes, I was quite fast.

LINE
At the top of the stairs, turn left

LINE
and then down the hall.

LINE
Ah. I must remember to try and catch up with you.

LINE
- As a specialist?
- But of course.

LINE
Now I want you to lift the nose of the statue.

LINE
Pardon?

LINE
You lift the nose, you flip the switch, and the door behind the statue opens.

LINE
I'm afraid Bryce has been a very naughty boy.

LINE
I wonder what you tweak to close it.

LINE
Well, Bryce, I wondered what had happened to you.

LINE
What you up to?

LINE
Sneaking a smoke? Or...

LINE
zipping a network?

LINE
Edison, how did you get in here?

LINE
I think we better go have a little talk.

LINE
Oh, and try and remember,

LINE
I was a kid once too.

LINE
I wish you hadn't kept anything from me.

LINE
- Like what?
- Your record.

LINE
But he hasn't got a record. He's a Blank.

LINE
Previous criminal activities.

LINE
They can't have any files on me.

LINE
I've been off the records for years.

LINE
The network police ran a computer investigation.

LINE
They say the probability is you committed these crimes.

LINE
Oh, probability.

LINE
Yes, Dominique.

LINE
If the probability computes, and in cases where there's no evidence, they work on the probability.

LINE
Well, I expect it saves everybody a lot of work.

LINE
It's not gonna save you, Reg.

LINE
You compute.

LINE
And the punishment for network program zipping

LINE
is terminal.

LINE
You put together pieces of my sat cam sequence

LINE
from the purge directory?

LINE
Most of it. The computer did the rest.

LINE
Man. I gotta recode that sat cam program to wipe out all the files before dumping them.

LINE
We saw how you altered the target from ACS to Big-Time.

LINE
Computer-enhanced files.

LINE
Illegally obtained.

LINE
You can't use that against me, Edison.

LINE
That's inadmissible evidence.

LINE
We don't want to use anything against you, Bryce.

LINE
- We want to help Reg. So should you.
- Why?

LINE
Because you've put him in very serious danger.

LINE
Bryce, I'm getting angry.

LINE
Then stop. It's quite unnecessary.

LINE
Blank Reg didn't zip our transmissions, right?

LINE
You know he didn't.

LINE
Why did you do it?

LINE
I mean, why Reg, of all people?

LINE
I had to make a quick decision.

LINE
I had to protect ACS, didn't I?

LINE
I don't believe it. An emotion.

LINE
A decision, Edison.

LINE
I simply selected the closest option that would achieve that goal.

LINE
Now, Blank Reg couldn't be proven guilty. It's an optimum solution.

LINE
What about right and wrong?

LINE
Non-empirical concepts.

LINE
Don't you understand? The network court wants to make an example of someone.

LINE
And Reg is it.

LINE
Network courts.

LINE
Our courts.

LINE
All we have to do is rearrange the information.

LINE
As long as no one finds out about ACS.

LINE
Bryce, stop treating people like machines.

LINE
You can't rearrange information which is evidence.

LINE
Grow up.

LINE
Okay, okay, so you were right.

LINE
He is an obstinate little child.

LINE
Where are you going, Edison?

LINE
Cheviot's office.

LINE
Maybe I can get him to fix things with the network court.

LINE
You're just like Bryce.

LINE
- What?
- Fix things with the court.

LINE
- I mean, what about Reg?
- I care about Reg.

LINE
What about justice? You don't need to fix it. He didn't do it.

LINE
But how do we prove he didn't do it?

LINE
Bryce is right.

LINE
We can't use the information he accessed and we can't testify for Reg.

LINE
As 23's employees, our evidence is inadmissible in 23's court.

LINE
Unless Bryce helps,

LINE
Reg is in very real trouble.

LINE
Well, I'm gonna go and see Reg.

LINE
I mean, there must be a way of proving he's incapable of zipping from Big-Time.

LINE
If Bryce won't help, I will.

LINE
Why are you smirking at me like that?

LINE
Me? Smirk?

LINE
That's not in my pro-pro-program.

LINE
I thought you were on my side.

LINE
It's not a ques-question of sides anymore, Bryce.

LINE
Ha ha. Except for the right side.

LINE
I'm uncharacteristically confused.

LINE
I'm used to logic, not opinion.

LINE
The thing... The thing is you're a bit like me.

LINE
Ex-Except we've got different bits.

LINE
Sometimes I think I could use some leg-legs, and right now I think you-you-you could use some conscience.

LINE
Which file is it in?

LINE
Think of yourself as a human program and that bit of you has developed a glitch-ch-ch.

LINE
Developed a glitch.

LINE
Everyone keeps lecturing me these days.

LINE
That's why I'm just talk-talk-t-talking to you about getting Blank Reg released.

LINE
I know.

LINE
Yes, sir. That's right, sir. We dropped off three more.

LINE
Leave the truck around the loading dock.

LINE
If you told your lawyer about your criminal profile, she might have been better prepared to defend you.

LINE
I told you, Dom, I didn't know.

LINE
How could you not know you had a criminal profile?

LINE
It's something called

LINE
the *Career Capability Malfeasance Program*.

LINE
CPMP.

LINE
It's the program that matches Blanks with unassigned profiles.

LINE
It compares the crime template to the personality template.

LINE
And if it matches, you're assumed guilty.

LINE
Criminals can blank out their identities, but they can't get rid of their criminal profile.

LINE
Are you saying there are more criminal profiles than there are criminals?

LINE
Precisely.

LINE
If a Blank is arrested now, they run a CPMP on him.

LINE
If the computer says the probability is high enough, it's considered a match.

LINE
So that isn't really your profile.

LINE
That's what I've been trying to tell you. Blimey, Dom.

LINE
Isn't science wonderful?

LINE
- Oh, Reg.
- Yeah, wonderfully inhuman.

LINE
I'm gonna go to 23.

LINE
Our only chance is to get Murray to authorize this as a story.

LINE
Template matching isn't justice. It's just administrative convenience.

LINE
Administrators. Button pushers.

LINE
Hold on, Reg.

LINE
As they say, the last resort of the innocent is always publicity.

LINE
Watch me.

LINE
Nicholas.

LINE
We need a real-time conference.

LINE
What's tickling your synapses?

LINE
Now look. In my day, zipping used to be a good hack.

LINE
But things have changed.

LINE
It's a criminal offense now.

LINE
And by trying to protect you and ACS, I'm in conflict with my own network.

LINE
So?

LINE
So flatline the project and submit a report to your sysop.

LINE
That's not a winning option.

LINE
You're a minor. They won't do anything to you.

LINE
They'll dump me from the Academy, Bryce.

LINE
Look, as long as nobody says anything,

LINE
nobody gets in trouble.

LINE
Blank Reg does.

LINE
Who? That guy?

LINE
He's just an old Blank.

LINE
But he didn't do it. We both know that.

LINE
That's irrelevant. Is this what happens when you have to work around computer illiterates?

LINE
You're really not compiling this, are you, Nicholas?

LINE
You did it. Blank Reg didn't. Facts.

LINE
Give me credit, Bryce. I've got it all worked out.

LINE
I'm sure your procedures are impeccable.

LINE
But you're using the wrong formula.

LINE
You remind me of myself.

LINE
Should I take that as a compliment?

LINE
No.

LINE
Calm down, Reg. I'm sure Miss Keeler is on her way.

LINE
If she's late for my trial, I'll kill her.

LINE
All homicide threats are recorded for later playback.

LINE
Stick that in your pipe and smoke it, sunshine.

LINE
Bryce.

LINE
I'm at the Academy.

LINE
I just had a real-time conference with the zipping hacker.

LINE
- Nicholas.
- That's wonderful.

LINE
No, it's not.

LINE
It didn't work.

LINE
I don't know what to do, Theora. Help me.

LINE
What is it?

LINE
We just found out who the guest prosecutor is.

LINE
Paul Wade?

LINE
But he's the frontman for 23's "You the Jury" show.

LINE
And the best television prosecutor money can buy.

LINE
It's a game show for my life.

LINE
Welcome to Network 23's award-winning game show _You the Jury_.

LINE
This is the defendant,

LINE
Blank Reg, a pirate TV operator employed by Big-Time Television,

LINE
who Network 23 has charged with first-degree signal zipping.

LINE
These are the Metrocops who claim they caught Blank Reg in the act.

LINE
And this is the TV pirate's attorney, Shelley Keeler.

LINE
Shelley's got her work cut out for her, because today's guest prosecutor is the Channel of Fortune's leading quiz master, Paul Wade.

LINE
On the show where the audience decides the verdict, _You the Jury_.

LINE
We'll be back with our first pleading in just a moment, but first, this word.

LINE
If you want to do
justice to your cooking,

LINE
try Zik-Zak Soy Muffin Mix.

LINE
Tasteless, colorless,
and odorless.

LINE
The perfect base
for every taste.

LINE
Don't be guilty that
they have no taste.

LINE
I know, Mr. Cheviot,
but Edison insisted.

LINE
All right, Murray, put him on.

LINE
Yes, Carter.

LINE
Your network court is on the
verge of convicting an innocent man.

LINE
That's an awfully serious
charge. Can you back it up?

LINE
I can.

LINE
But I need you to buy
me a little more time.

LINE
Are you asking me to subvert
the network's judicial process?

LINE
Quite the contrary.

LINE
I believe the true source of
the zipping is not Blank Reg,

LINE
but the Academy of
Computer Sciences.

LINE
For God's sake, Edison,

LINE
those youngsters represent
the distillation of human intellect.

LINE
They're the root
stock of the future.

LINE
Bryce Lynch is
the product of ACS.

LINE
And Bryce is covering this
up by changing the coordinates

LINE
away from the true
source of the zipping.

LINE
If that's true, if our own head
of research and development

LINE
is responsible for
covering up a crime

LINE
which cost this network
hundreds of thousands of credits,

LINE
we'll be the laughingstock
of the industry.

LINE
We could lose the
entire Zik-Zak account.

LINE
Mr. Cheviot, couldn't we
reschedule the network court?

LINE
Give Edison some time
to clean up this mess.

LINE
Please. Sir, the
accused is Blank Reg.

LINE
I'm sorry about Blank
Reg, believe me.

LINE
If he's innocent, I'm
sure he'll be acquitted.

LINE
He's only one man.

LINE
I have to concern myself
with the greatest good

LINE
for the greatest
number of people.

LINE
Which means this entire network.

LINE
No, Murray. I won't reschedule.

LINE
Better find Bryce.

LINE
It's time for kill or cure.

LINE
Welcome back to<i> You the Jury.</i>

LINE
And now, here's the judge.

LINE
Thank you. Hello, hello, hello.

LINE
Oh, thank you, thank you.

LINE
And welcome to the
show that puts you

LINE
in the jury box.

LINE
Our first case today
involves a charge of zipping

LINE
against a Blank Reg.

LINE
For 1,000 credits, how does
your client plead, Ms. Keeler?

LINE
Innocent. I...

LINE
I mean, not guilty, sir.

LINE
Just relax, Ms. Keeler.

LINE
Proceed with your opening
argument, Mr. Wade.

LINE
Thanks, Bob.

LINE
Ladies and gentlemen, the
prosecution intends to prove

LINE
beyond a shadow of a doubt

LINE
that the Blank known as Reg

LINE
is guilty of network zipping.

LINE
What we're really talking
about here is principle.

LINE
What we're talking about
is a threat to television.

LINE
To our lives.

LINE
We are talking
about interruptioning.

LINE
When decent, honest,
peaceful television-loving people

LINE
cannot watch<i> Shoppin' Spree</i>
without these savage attacks

LINE
on their viewing freedom,

LINE
we have to ask this question.

LINE
Are we being too lenient?

LINE
When our wives and daughters

LINE
cannot shop from their
own homes in peace,

LINE
we must ask is consumerism
itself under attack?

LINE
Credit for your thoughts.

LINE
Save your money, Edison.

LINE
You already know.

LINE
I don't want to sound paranoid,

LINE
but...

LINE
I know this place is bugged.

LINE
Now we're in a cone of silence.

LINE
No one can eavesdrop.

LINE
I tried to redirect Nicholas,

LINE
but he's a poorly
designed system.

LINE
What system?

LINE
The system that allows him to
be better off by keeping quiet.

LINE
I mean, what good is a system
if it doesn't work properly?

LINE
I hate to be the one to
break this to you, Bryce,

LINE
but life is more than just
interactive systems analysis.

LINE
Not really.

LINE
It's a matter of information.

LINE
Once we understand and
collate our ideas, life will be

LINE
much simpler, really.

LINE
It's a matter of
number crunching.

LINE
It's not just more complicated.

LINE
Look, life is based on
something more than just logic.

LINE
It's based on...

LINE
feelings.

LINE
So everyone keeps telling me.

LINE
Is it difficult to keep
your feelings at bay?

LINE
Well, you can

LINE
switch them off when
they become inconvenient.

LINE
It's just that every time you do,
you become a byte less human.

LINE
But what if a microchip
failed to work properly

LINE
because it had to make a moral
decision every time it switched?

LINE
Okay.

LINE
And what if you created
an artificial intelligence

LINE
and it wouldn't work because it
disagreed with your principles?

LINE
Then you have a choice which is
not just a yes/no binary absolute.

LINE
It's a question of conscience.

LINE
Yeah.

LINE
Conscience.

LINE
Better work that one out.

LINE
Look,

LINE
I really enjoyed this little
chat, but I gotta get going.

LINE
I gotta go watch a friend of mine
go down for something he didn't do.

LINE
Well, at least you'll
understand that.

LINE
So, my little ch-ch-chip
off the old mainframe,

LINE
what are you going to do?

LINE
Well,

LINE
I think I need to rewrite
my own program.

LINE
Okay. Now, moving on to our
second round of questioning.

LINE
Oh, that's the
plea-bargaining buzzer.

LINE
Approach the bench, guys.

LINE
According to our
rolling audience poll,

LINE
the Blank Reg should be
reduced to random electrons

LINE
by a margin of 9 to 1.

LINE
This is my first and
last offer, sweetheart.

LINE
If the Blank cops to zipping,
I'll settle for life and a day.

LINE
I have to confer with my client.

LINE
Will she go for
the life and a day,

LINE
or try to get the Blank free?

LINE
Let's ask some of the folks
in the gallery what they think.

LINE
- This is the deal.
- I understand the offer.

LINE
If I confess to
something I didn't do,

LINE
I go to prison for
the rest of me life.

LINE
Stuff it. I'd make a
very bad prisoner.

LINE
They used the phrase
random electrons.

LINE
I can't spell that, either.

LINE
It means no?

LINE
Conference time's up.
Approach the bench.

LINE
So, what'll it be, Shelley?

LINE
We're gonna go for it.

LINE
Oh, they're gonna go for it.

LINE
Nicholas. You've been cheating.

LINE
Nice try.

LINE
Cheating?

LINE
Loading inaccurate information

LINE
designed to crash
a logic program.

LINE
And output bias to produce
selective information.

LINE
And putting it
simply, Nick, lying.

LINE
We couldn't.

LINE
The coordinates are clear.

LINE
It really was the Big-Time
bus the zipping came from.

LINE
Blank Reg must be brilliant.

LINE
And guilty.

LINE
Hey, let's watch his sentencing.

LINE
Blank Reg, eh?

LINE
Fancy being able
to zip a live program.

LINE
Bryce, you're making a
mistake in your old age.

LINE
You can't tell one set of
coordinates from another.

LINE
I assumed you guys had learned
something since I was here,

LINE
but it's evident
that your generation

LINE
hasn't the skills nor
the system for zipping.

LINE
What would you call this setup?

LINE
Toys for Tots.

LINE
You're taking credit
for Reg's achievement.

LINE
You're obviously trying
to impress the girls.

LINE
Say when, Mr. Lynch.

LINE
Nicholas, you're
behaving emotionally.

LINE
Shut up.

LINE
You wouldn't dare.

LINE
Jury find Blank...

LINE
I move for dismissal.

LINE
Hold it. Looks like we've
got a move for dismissal.

LINE
- On what grounds, Ms. Keeler?
- Pure logic.

LINE
My client, Blank Reg, couldn't possibly
have caused the zipping you just saw.

LINE
He's here in the court.

LINE
Oh.

LINE
Dismissed.

LINE
Oh, Dom, that's the first time

LINE
you've ever had
your arms around me.

LINE
Oh, Reggie, darling.

LINE
Ugh, about your
personal hygiene.

LINE
Oh.

LINE
What made Bryce change his mind?

LINE
He didn't. He adjusted
his parameters.

LINE
Think it'll make him
any easier to work with?

LINE
Never. Con-Con-Converts
are the worst kind of bigots.

LINE
One of yours?

LINE
One of my best.
