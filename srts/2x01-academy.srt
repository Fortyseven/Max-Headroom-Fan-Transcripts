00:00:01,936 --> 00:00:03,068
This is Edison Carter,

2
00:00:03,136 --> 00:00:04,945
coming to you very
much live and direct

3
00:00:04,969 --> 00:00:06,300
on Network 23.

4
00:00:06,369 --> 00:00:07,878
Carter's the best known reporter

5
00:00:07,902 --> 00:00:09,366
we have on the air.

6
00:00:09,435 --> 00:00:11,400
He satellites globally.

7
00:00:11,468 --> 00:00:12,877
Where does all this
stuff come from, Bryce?

8
00:00:12,901 --> 00:00:16,000
The components of Carter's mind.

9
00:00:16,068 --> 00:00:17,666
M-M-Max, M-M-Max.

10
00:00:17,734 --> 00:00:20,000
People translated as data.

11
00:00:20,068 --> 00:00:21,878
It's computer-generated,
whatever it is.

12
00:00:21,902 --> 00:00:23,232
It looks like Edison.

13
00:00:23,301 --> 00:00:25,299
Max. Max Headroom.

14
00:00:25,367 --> 00:00:26,898
Max?

15
00:00:26,967 --> 00:00:29,466
He's a computer-generated
person based on you.

16
00:00:29,534 --> 00:00:32,466
Two minds, but with
one single memory.

00:02:08,361 --> 00:02:10,592
Are you tired of complaints

28
00:02:10,661 --> 00:02:12,191
about sagging buns

29
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,793

I don't know how you

One of my little pleasures.

Makes me happy.

Zik-Zak muffin is it.

And the packaging is
perfect as a soiree purse.

40
00:02:43,892 --> 00:02:48,889
You know, this home
shop-shop-shopping show is great.

41
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:53,223
From start to finish, it's just
sell, sell, sell, sell, sell, sell.

00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:57,322
At last, a show with
no-no-no commercials.

00:02:57,391 --> 00:02:59,789
Go away.

44

Reg, Max is ruining my program.

00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:05,588
Good.

46
00:03:05,656 --> 00:03:08,122
Honestly, someone at Network 23

47
00:03:08,191 --> 00:03:10,069
ought to do something about him.

48
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:14,721
Reg.

49
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,887

Ow! Bleeding hell, Dom,

52
00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:25,331
nearly ripped me
bleeding ears off.

53
00:03:25,355 --> 00:03:27,520
Come here.

54
00:03:27,588 --> 00:03:28,821
Blimey, what is it?

55
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:30,153
Look.

56
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:36,019
Well, that's not Max, Dom.

57
00:03:36,088 --> 00:03:37,653
It's those zippers again.

58
00:03:37,721 --> 00:03:39,987
They must have
a hell of a setup.

59
00:03:40,055 --> 00:03:42,664
Zipping into network
transmissions takes a lot of power.

60
00:03:42,688 --> 00:03:44,919
Well, they're
ruining my shopping.

61
00:03:44,988 --> 00:03:46,986
Takes a lot of nerve as well.

62
00:03:53,386 --> 00:03:54,852
How are they doing this?

63
00:03:54,921 --> 00:03:57,396
Well, you see, they hack
into our satellite transponders

64
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,096
and they hijack our frequency.

65
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,218
Ashwell, Lauren means how
are they cracking our security?

66
00:04:03,287 --> 00:04:04,717
Oh.

67
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:07,529
They flatten our ratings
every time they zip us like that.

68
00:04:07,553 --> 00:04:08,750
Look at those figures.

69
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:11,718
Shoppin' Spree TV is diving.

70
00:04:11,787 --> 00:04:14,251
Viewers won't stand for this.

71
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:15,618
This has got to be stopped.

72
00:04:15,686 --> 00:04:17,117
This is dangerous.

73
00:04:17,186 --> 00:04:18,562
If they can break into
our carrier that easily,

74
00:04:18,586 --> 00:04:19,883
nothing's safe.

75
00:04:19,951 --> 00:04:21,694
Our bank accounts,
our medical records.

76
00:04:21,718 --> 00:04:23,817
Never mind that.
What about ratings?

77
00:04:23,885 --> 00:04:26,184
I've already
alerted Bryce Lynch.

78
00:04:26,251 --> 00:04:28,416
He's been trying to
track them for some time.

79
00:04:28,485 --> 00:04:30,583
He was a hacker
himself, you know.

80
00:04:30,652 --> 00:04:33,282
Send a thief to catch a thief.

81
00:04:37,051 --> 00:04:38,482
Ah, Bryce.

82
00:04:38,551 --> 00:04:40,183
You get that last zipping?

83
00:04:40,252 --> 00:04:41,849
Of course.

84
00:04:41,917 --> 00:04:44,349
I've isolated the satellite
they're hacking into.

85
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:47,682
Now, it wasn't easy, because
they hacked our security...

86
00:04:47,751 --> 00:04:50,648
Bryce, just the
conclusion will be fine.

87
00:04:50,717 --> 00:04:52,714
The conclusion, Mr. Cheviot,

88
00:04:52,783 --> 00:04:55,547
is that they are extremely good.

89
00:04:55,616 --> 00:04:59,848
But not as good
as I am, naturally.

90
00:04:59,917 --> 00:05:01,459
Would you like to
watch my endgame?

91
00:05:01,483 --> 00:05:02,813
He thinks this is a game.

92
00:05:02,882 --> 00:05:04,847
He thinks everything's a game.

93
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:06,914
Don't you, Bryce?

94
00:05:06,982 --> 00:05:11,280
Yes. I often play chess
with the 23 computer.

95
00:05:11,348 --> 00:05:13,580
And I often beat it.

96
00:05:13,648 --> 00:05:16,580
Ah, here we go. Would
you like to watch?

97
00:05:31,047 --> 00:05:32,146
You've got it.

98
00:05:32,214 --> 00:05:34,145
Well done, Bryce.

99
00:05:41,413 --> 00:05:45,812
Uh, I think there's
a little error.

100
00:05:45,881 --> 00:05:49,044
Can you hang on just one minute?

101
00:06:08,645 --> 00:06:10,143
There's your target.

102
00:06:10,212 --> 00:06:14,043
That's it, Mr. Cheviot.
You've got your zipper.

103
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:21,209
Let me have security.

104
00:06:22,677 --> 00:06:26,076
You're tuned to
Big-Time Television.

105
00:06:26,145 --> 00:06:29,274
Where music is the
brandy of the damned.

106
00:06:29,343 --> 00:06:32,408
So, let's pop the cork on this.

107
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:42,974
Go, go, go.

108
00:06:55,042 --> 00:06:57,406
Hold on, Dominique,
he just walked in.

109
00:06:57,475 --> 00:06:59,618
You see what that explosion
did to the people in that city,

110
00:06:59,642 --> 00:07:01,785
you'll know why they
call it a breeder reactor.

111
00:07:01,809 --> 00:07:03,139
Edison, it's Dominique.

112
00:07:03,207 --> 00:07:04,839
Blank Reg has been arrested.

113
00:07:08,574 --> 00:07:09,672
What happened?

114
00:07:09,741 --> 00:07:12,372
Metrocops. They said
he was signal zipping.

115
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,440
Reg? That's crazy.

116
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:15,106
That's way out of his league.

117
00:07:15,173 --> 00:07:16,717
Reg asked me to call you.

118
00:07:16,741 --> 00:07:18,972
Edison, you've got to help him.

119
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,338
Where are they holding him?

120
00:07:20,407 --> 00:07:22,938
Metro jail 42.

121
00:07:23,007 --> 00:07:25,371
I'm on my way.

122
00:07:55,772 --> 00:07:57,403
Insert credit tube.

123
00:08:07,004 --> 00:08:08,935
Now, just tell me the truth.

124
00:08:09,004 --> 00:08:12,369
Were you zipping into Network
23 transmissions from Big-Time?

125
00:08:12,437 --> 00:08:14,135
Do me a favor, girl.

126
00:08:14,204 --> 00:08:16,613
There's not enough power in
that bus to zip up me trousers,

127
00:08:16,637 --> 00:08:18,515
never mind a network satellite.

128
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:21,868
I don't think you understand
the severity of this charge.

129
00:08:21,936 --> 00:08:25,368
Network zipping
is a prime offense.

130
00:08:25,437 --> 00:08:29,101
- Sir.
- I understand
one thing, darling.

131
00:08:29,169 --> 00:08:31,266
Someone's trying to frame me.

132
00:08:31,335 --> 00:08:33,066
And when I find who,

133
00:08:33,135 --> 00:08:35,333
I'm gonna unilaterally
murder the swine.

134
00:08:35,402 --> 00:08:37,434
Watch your threats.

135
00:08:37,502 --> 00:08:38,766
We are being monitored.

136
00:08:38,835 --> 00:08:40,666
Now, we might have a chance,

137
00:08:40,735 --> 00:08:42,311
as long as you
aren't a recidivist.

138
00:08:42,335 --> 00:08:44,700
Me? No way.

139
00:08:44,768 --> 00:08:46,399
I can't even spell it.

140
00:08:46,468 --> 00:08:48,386
You don't have
a criminal profile?

141
00:08:48,434 --> 00:08:50,365
That's right.

142
00:08:50,434 --> 00:08:52,466
Of course I don't.

143
00:08:52,534 --> 00:08:54,699
Edison, you've got
to get me out of this.

144
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:57,166
Someone is setting
me up. Right up.

145
00:08:58,667 --> 00:09:01,198
All rise for the most
highly rated judge.

146
00:09:17,699 --> 00:09:19,297
Please approach the bench.

147
00:09:22,932 --> 00:09:25,630
Your honor, the network
has reason to believe

148
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:27,508
that an indictment
of first-degree zipping

149
00:09:27,532 --> 00:09:28,875
should be brought
against this defendant.

150
00:09:28,899 --> 00:09:31,164
Counsel for the defense.

151
00:09:31,231 --> 00:09:32,842
I move for dismissal
on the grounds

152
00:09:32,866 --> 00:09:35,040
that the network has no
first-hand corroboration

153
00:09:35,064 --> 00:09:36,574
that my client
committed this crime.

154
00:09:36,598 --> 00:09:38,996
He's a Blank, your honor.

155
00:09:39,065 --> 00:09:40,065
A Blank?

156
00:09:40,131 --> 00:09:41,330
In that case,

157
00:09:41,398 --> 00:09:42,962
he's beyond my jurisprudence.

158
00:09:43,032 --> 00:09:44,528
Video court.

159
00:09:44,597 --> 00:09:46,796
But you haven't
evaluated my floppy disc.

160
00:09:46,864 --> 00:09:50,429
The charges stand.

161
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:58,873
We've got to pick a court date.

162
00:09:58,897 --> 00:10:00,639
Would you care to do the honors?

163
00:10:00,663 --> 00:10:02,727
No thanks.

164
00:10:02,796 --> 00:10:04,427
All yours.

165
00:10:14,829 --> 00:10:17,326
I play Grateful Dead
on Wednesdays.

166
00:10:17,395 --> 00:10:20,226
It only gives me one day
to prepare your defense.

167
00:10:25,362 --> 00:10:27,826
You believe me,
don't you, old son?

168
00:10:27,894 --> 00:10:32,359
Yeah. You didn't, you
couldn't, and you wouldn't.

169
00:10:32,428 --> 00:10:36,025
Question is, who did?

170
00:10:52,326 --> 00:10:53,326
How's Reg?

171
00:10:53,393 --> 00:10:55,492
He's pretty angry, all right.

172
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,791
What you got?

173
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:00,325
Well, Bryce coordinated
the targeting for that raid.

174
00:11:00,392 --> 00:11:03,256
It seems he had a problem
and it switched from mid-set,

175
00:11:03,326 --> 00:11:05,190
which is very strange.

176
00:11:05,258 --> 00:11:06,624
Can it be switched?

177
00:11:06,692 --> 00:11:09,224
Yeah, it could, but why?

178
00:11:09,292 --> 00:11:12,889
Okay, the sat cam program
produces a lot of temporary files.

179
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:15,190
Then discards them.

180
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:17,201
All those bits and pieces
go into the purge directory,

181
00:11:17,225 --> 00:11:19,134
which is a sort of
electronic trash bin.

182
00:11:19,158 --> 00:11:20,900
- Mm-hmm.
- Which the systems operator

183
00:11:20,924 --> 00:11:22,823
empties at the end of the day.

184
00:11:22,892 --> 00:11:24,355
Everything ends up in there.

185
00:11:24,424 --> 00:11:27,101
Discarded files, bits and
pieces of video outtakes,

186
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:29,289
messages.

187
00:11:29,358 --> 00:11:32,022
I'll see what I can find.

188
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:35,121
Praying, Bryce?

189
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,789
No.

190
00:11:36,857 --> 00:11:37,857
No need, huh?

191
00:11:37,891 --> 00:11:39,789
No.

192
00:11:39,856 --> 00:11:42,654
Oh, good. Oh, good.

193
00:11:42,722 --> 00:11:44,654
Game of chess?

194
00:11:44,722 --> 00:11:46,788
No thanks, Max.

195
00:11:46,856 --> 00:11:48,754
You can be white.

196
00:11:48,823 --> 00:11:50,420
No thanks, Max, really.

197
00:11:50,489 --> 00:11:52,354
I'm thinking.

198
00:11:52,422 --> 00:11:54,787
I'm evaluating a
recent strategy.

199
00:11:54,856 --> 00:11:57,954
I know.

200
00:11:58,022 --> 00:11:59,187
Did it work?

201
00:11:59,256 --> 00:12:00,421
What?

202
00:12:00,488 --> 00:12:02,887
Switching the coordinates.

203
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:04,386
How on earth did you know?

204
00:12:04,455 --> 00:12:08,553
I happened to be flit-flit-flitting
about the mainframe

205
00:12:08,622 --> 00:12:12,419
and I just watched the show.

206
00:12:12,488 --> 00:12:14,552
You won't tell.

207
00:12:14,621 --> 00:12:15,919
Will you?

208
00:12:21,353 --> 00:12:25,585
These files write over themselves
a lot before they're thrown away.

209
00:12:25,654 --> 00:12:28,684
I'll get the computer
to extrapolate it for us.

210
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,917
Now, those are the
coordinates of the target.

211
00:12:37,986 --> 00:12:40,518
But look, they switch
and give us another set.

212
00:12:40,586 --> 00:12:42,017
What are the new coordinates?

213
00:12:47,253 --> 00:12:50,751
Big-Time Television.

214
00:12:50,819 --> 00:12:52,428
What are the
original coordinates?

215
00:12:52,452 --> 00:12:55,717
I'm beginning to get a very
nasty tingle in my spine.

216
00:12:55,786 --> 00:12:57,983
Well, that's good.
Probably means a story.

217
00:12:58,052 --> 00:12:59,561
It's not nice to
eavesdrop, Murray.

218
00:12:59,585 --> 00:13:02,350
It's not nice to falsify
evidence, either.

219
00:13:02,418 --> 00:13:04,217
Let's have the coordinates.

220
00:13:05,052 --> 00:13:07,515
My God, it's ACS.

221
00:13:07,584 --> 00:13:09,482
The Academy of
Computer Sciences.

222
00:13:09,551 --> 00:13:11,782
Now, that is a story.

223
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:14,948
Network 23's computer wiz
kids zipping their own channel?

224
00:13:15,017 --> 00:13:16,416
That's a story, all right.

225
00:13:16,483 --> 00:13:17,814
Yeah, I get your point.

226
00:13:17,883 --> 00:13:19,748
A bit sensitive.

227
00:13:19,816 --> 00:13:21,626
Sensitive? You
can say that again.

228
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:23,448
All right. Go to ACS.

229
00:13:23,517 --> 00:13:25,715
Lay some story on them,
see just what's going on.

230
00:13:25,783 --> 00:13:27,092
Murray, Bryce Lynch on line two.

231
00:13:27,116 --> 00:13:28,314
Yeah.

232
00:13:28,383 --> 00:13:32,081
- Theora.
- It'll be fun, Edison.

233
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:33,547
Like going back to school.

234
00:13:33,615 --> 00:13:36,547
- Theora.
- What?

235
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:40,513
We both know something
else about ACS, don't we?

236
00:13:40,582 --> 00:13:42,580
Yes, we do.

237
00:13:42,649 --> 00:13:44,213
It's where Bryce came from.

238
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:46,180
We got a problem.

239
00:13:46,249 --> 00:13:47,591
Listen, I have a great idea.

240
00:13:47,615 --> 00:13:49,157
I just told Bryce
to go with you.

241
00:13:49,181 --> 00:13:50,858
You see, he'll be
able to talk to the kids,

242
00:13:50,882 --> 00:13:52,880
help you subvert
the little geniuses.

243
00:13:54,482 --> 00:13:56,746
What's the matter?

244
00:13:56,815 --> 00:13:58,945
What is the matter?

245
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,811
Well?

246
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,146
Well what?

247
00:14:04,214 --> 00:14:07,112
W-Well, as they said
to K-K-King Charles I

248
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,044
on the scaffold,

249
00:14:09,113 --> 00:14:10,955
are you-are you
going to go quietly?

250
00:14:10,979 --> 00:14:12,278
Or do you need a push?

251
00:14:12,347 --> 00:14:15,178
To ACS?

252
00:14:15,247 --> 00:14:17,123
Murray asked me to.
I have to help Edison.

253
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:18,922
What could I say?
I have no choice.

254
00:14:18,946 --> 00:14:22,411
Of course-Of course
you have a choice.

255
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,978
The same one Charles I had.

256
00:14:25,046 --> 00:14:27,077
Exactly.

257
00:14:29,945 --> 00:14:32,077
Will you come with me?

258
00:14:32,146 --> 00:14:35,877
I think I have a problem.

259
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:57,120
Academy of Computer
Sciences fourth period pod begins

260
00:14:57,144 --> 00:14:59,908
in exactly 1 minute
and 3.0 seconds.

261
00:14:59,977 --> 00:15:03,474
Your assignment for this
period is to compute ten designs

262
00:15:03,543 --> 00:15:08,607
for peizo polymer fingers
of a surgical robot hand.

263
00:15:08,676 --> 00:15:11,251
Also, please note that
we have distinguished

264
00:15:11,275 --> 00:15:13,107
visitors from Network 23 today.

265
00:15:13,176 --> 00:15:15,240
So please show them
how courteous we are.

266
00:15:17,776 --> 00:15:19,440
The spore is loaded.

267
00:15:19,508 --> 00:15:21,041
You take the first watch.

268
00:15:21,109 --> 00:15:23,174
Look here, that's me.

269
00:15:23,241 --> 00:15:26,939
Oh, yeah. You trying to
tell me you had sideburns?

270
00:15:27,008 --> 00:15:29,006
Yeah.

271
00:15:29,075 --> 00:15:30,640
This bring back memories?

272
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:32,040
Some.

273
00:15:32,108 --> 00:15:33,717
Most memories are
the random retrieval

274
00:15:33,741 --> 00:15:35,339
of normally superfluous data.

275
00:15:35,407 --> 00:15:37,773
A waste of real time.

276
00:15:37,841 --> 00:15:39,706
I try to bulk erase mine daily.

277
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:41,483
Yeah, well, be careful
you don't erase all the bits

278
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:42,666
that add up to experience.

279
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,050
Oh, I keep the
critical material.

280
00:15:44,074 --> 00:15:46,738
I remember my first
undergraduate day here.

281
00:15:46,807 --> 00:15:50,838
It was Tuesday. It was
raining, and I was cold.

282
00:15:50,907 --> 00:15:53,437
Huh. Your random recall
is almost as good as Max'.

283
00:15:53,506 --> 00:15:55,072
Oh, that's not random.

284
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,604
That was my tenth birthday.

285
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,303
They've separated.

286
00:16:10,372 --> 00:16:12,671
These kids are bright.

287
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:14,282
They're into
securicams everywhere.

288
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,415
I mean, I'm tapping
off their illicit feeds.

289
00:16:16,439 --> 00:16:17,614
Which makes you even brighter.

290
00:16:17,638 --> 00:16:19,936
- Older.
- Wiser.

291
00:16:20,005 --> 00:16:21,636
Marry me, Murray.

292
00:16:26,437 --> 00:16:29,835
Announcement.
Nanotechnology pod test results

293
00:16:29,904 --> 00:16:32,741
are posted in the sub-micron
lab for your viewing.

294
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:48,434
Headsysop.

295
00:16:48,503 --> 00:16:51,400
Does it teach or devour maidens?

296
00:16:56,403 --> 00:16:59,568
Announcement. Students
are reminded not to leave

297
00:16:59,636 --> 00:17:03,000
their mutated molecules
in their lockers overnight.

298
00:17:27,101 --> 00:17:29,265
Well, we haven't got
any absolute proof.

299
00:17:29,334 --> 00:17:31,831
But the signals were
tracked to this campus.

300
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,543
Naturally, I'm more
inquisitive than anything else.

301
00:17:34,567 --> 00:17:35,932
Naturally.

302
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,165
Are you positive about this?

303
00:17:38,234 --> 00:17:40,076
One of your former
students did the tracking.

304
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:43,231
Bryce Lynch. And he
claims to be a genius, so...

305
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:46,830
Ah, Lynch. Excellent student.

306
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,097
Single-minded. Well,

307
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:50,809
ACS students don't
make mistakes,

308
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:53,297
and Lynch was
one of the very best.

309
00:17:53,365 --> 00:17:56,997
In his time, of course.

310
00:17:57,066 --> 00:17:58,930
Odd boy.

311
00:17:58,998 --> 00:18:02,296
He never made contact with
his parents after he came to us.

312
00:18:02,365 --> 00:18:07,296
They were middle
management, you know.

313
00:18:07,365 --> 00:18:09,362
I well remember...

314
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:11,796
Time for my 3:00 pod.

315
00:18:11,864 --> 00:18:13,474
I'll bring this up
after session.

316
00:18:13,498 --> 00:18:15,863
I'm as anxious as you
to get to the bottom of it.

317
00:18:15,931 --> 00:18:18,895
Headsysops, pods.

318
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:22,728
Tell you, in my day, it was
headmasters and classes.

319
00:18:22,797 --> 00:18:25,695
Yes, yes. How times change.

320
00:18:25,763 --> 00:18:27,895
We're all input
systems, operators,

321
00:18:27,964 --> 00:18:30,829
and pod managers now, my boy.

322
00:18:30,896 --> 00:18:33,428
But you can't fool and
old head, you know.

323
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:40,727
Settle down, settle
down. Order from chaos.

324
00:18:40,796 --> 00:18:42,694
And now, for your next project,

325
00:18:42,762 --> 00:18:45,627
you will each receive a package

326
00:18:45,696 --> 00:18:47,926
containing one floppy diskette,

327
00:18:47,995 --> 00:18:50,727
an old-fashioned 888 processor,

328
00:18:50,795 --> 00:18:53,693
and a coat hanger.

329
00:18:53,762 --> 00:18:57,359
With these materials, you will
be expected to design a device

330
00:18:57,428 --> 00:19:00,126
to snare Clifford here.

331
00:19:00,195 --> 00:19:03,392
We'll see which one of you
can build the better mousetrap.

332
00:19:03,461 --> 00:19:06,159
- Piece of cake.
- Piece of cheese.

333
00:19:06,227 --> 00:19:09,559
Your humor parameters
need expanding, Nicholas.

334
00:19:09,627 --> 00:19:11,425
Yes, Stratton?

335
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,458
Can we kill it?

336
00:19:14,526 --> 00:19:18,358
Yes, that is within the
bounds of the experiment.

337
00:19:18,426 --> 00:19:21,958
But I'm afraid you'll find that
more difficult than you imagine.

338
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:24,325
Uh, Miss Partridge?

339
00:19:26,126 --> 00:19:29,025
What are the time
parameters here?

340
00:19:29,092 --> 00:19:31,291
You may have until
the end of the day.

341
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:34,090
If there are no
further questions...

342
00:19:34,158 --> 00:19:35,990
Yes, Stratton?

343
00:19:36,058 --> 00:19:38,490
What's Edison Carter doing here?

344
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:40,756
Oh, once again my
little code crunchers

345
00:19:40,825 --> 00:19:43,256
are getting ahead
of their old sysop.

346
00:19:43,324 --> 00:19:45,857
Say hello to Mr. Edison Carter.

347
00:19:45,926 --> 00:19:48,189
Hello, Mr. Carter.

348
00:19:49,724 --> 00:19:51,955
He does look like Max Headroom.

349
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:56,256
Uh, no, actually.
He looks like me.

350
00:19:56,324 --> 00:20:00,222
Mr. Carter brings a
disturbing piece of information.

351
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:03,049
He suspects some
highly illegal signal zipping

352
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:05,588
has been emanating
from this campus.

353
00:20:06,689 --> 00:20:08,222
Now, if this is true,

354
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:11,054
I expect the responsible
party to report to my office.

355
00:20:11,123 --> 00:20:13,788
Because you are all minors,

356
00:20:13,856 --> 00:20:15,899
you will be spared the
particular punishment

357
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:18,321
usually afforded adults.

358
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:20,287
As I am fond of saying,

359
00:20:20,357 --> 00:20:23,187
we have our own methods.

360
00:20:23,256 --> 00:20:25,554
Pod dismissed.

361
00:20:36,055 --> 00:20:38,086
They seem like a
normal bunch of kids.

362
00:20:38,155 --> 00:20:40,387
- Oh, yes.
- Homicidal rodent squishers.

363
00:20:42,188 --> 00:20:43,631
You really expect
the guilty party

364
00:20:43,655 --> 00:20:45,230
just to march right
into your office?

365
00:20:45,254 --> 00:20:47,096
Of course. We
instill the morality

366
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,486
of binary absolutes
here, Mr. Carter.

367
00:20:49,555 --> 00:20:51,752
The useful
consequence of pure logic

368
00:20:51,821 --> 00:20:54,896
is the divine simplicity of a
yes/no decision about everything.

369
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,396
Well, what about
right and wrong?

370
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:59,229
I notice you said
"responsible party," not "guilty."

371
00:20:59,253 --> 00:21:02,184
A gray area is quite useless
to a computer specialist.

372
00:21:02,253 --> 00:21:05,719
We don't deal in guilt.
We deal in information.

373
00:21:05,786 --> 00:21:08,463
That is why the appropriate
party will be with us shortly.

374
00:21:08,487 --> 00:21:09,884
You will see.

375
00:21:09,953 --> 00:21:11,584
Let's adjourn to my office.

376
00:21:15,385 --> 00:21:19,317
Doesn't this place bring
back f-f-fond memories, Bryce?

377
00:21:19,386 --> 00:21:21,050
Ah-Ah-Ah, the sounds,

378
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:23,683
the s-s-squeak of
trainers on the gym floor,

379
00:21:23,752 --> 00:21:26,183
the screech of
ch-chalk on gallium chip.

380
00:21:26,252 --> 00:21:29,650
The secret kiss behind
the computer terminal.

381
00:21:29,718 --> 00:21:31,516
It wasn't like that.

382
00:21:31,585 --> 00:21:34,227
Why do people get so
sentimental about college days?

383
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:37,649
Because for
p-p-people like Edison,

384
00:21:37,717 --> 00:21:40,715
it was a time of
giggles, g-g-girls, guys,

385
00:21:40,784 --> 00:21:43,182
and g-g-getting into trouble.

386
00:21:43,251 --> 00:21:46,248
- Not me.
- Not yet.

387
00:21:46,317 --> 00:21:48,448
Bryce Lynch is in there.

388
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:52,382
Well, it's Bryce Lynch.

389
00:22:00,883 --> 00:22:02,114
We got the warning.

390
00:22:02,182 --> 00:22:03,947
Good. How's your security?

391
00:22:04,016 --> 00:22:07,114
Optimized. Only the
inner circle knows.

392
00:22:07,182 --> 00:22:08,347
What's that?

393
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:11,814
My computer regeneration
project. Max Headroom.

394
00:22:11,882 --> 00:22:14,480
Ah, yes. We've heard about that.

395
00:22:14,548 --> 00:22:15,980
Rather primitive.

396
00:22:16,049 --> 00:22:19,213
We're into cross-species
regeneration these days.

397
00:22:19,282 --> 00:22:21,912
A little more advanced.

398
00:22:21,981 --> 00:22:23,879
Se-Se-Se...

399
00:22:23,948 --> 00:22:27,013
Seems like a nice boy.

400
00:22:27,082 --> 00:22:30,345
Nicholas rather enjoys
his performances.

401
00:22:30,414 --> 00:22:32,612
Talk-Talk-Talking
of performances,

402
00:22:32,681 --> 00:22:34,911
if you're gonna get us
out of this m-m-mess

403
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:39,045
you got us into, you'll
need some fancy dancing.

404
00:22:43,914 --> 00:22:45,945
What puzzles me is

405
00:22:46,014 --> 00:22:48,511
how a former student
could have been incorrect

406
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:51,077
about ACS being the
source of the zipping.

407
00:22:51,146 --> 00:22:53,777
Bryce wasn't wrong.

408
00:22:53,845 --> 00:22:56,610
The party who did it
just isn't 'fessing up.

409
00:22:56,679 --> 00:22:58,644
Logically impure.

410
00:22:58,713 --> 00:23:02,210
It would assume that
there is a guilty party.

411
00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:04,476
It just doesn't compute.

412
00:23:04,545 --> 00:23:07,843
It would imply a gray area.

413
00:23:07,912 --> 00:23:10,377
Not at ACS, Mr. Carter.

414
00:23:10,445 --> 00:23:13,210
We work with
perfect information.

415
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:14,842
Paradise, huh?

416
00:23:16,577 --> 00:23:19,242
Well, maybe you got a
dragon in the Garden of Eden.

417
00:23:22,077 --> 00:23:23,953
You mind if I have a
look around on my own?

418
00:23:23,977 --> 00:23:26,909
No, no, not at all.

419
00:23:26,977 --> 00:23:28,242
But, Mr. Carter,

420
00:23:28,311 --> 00:23:30,808
beware the dragon.

421
00:23:35,377 --> 00:23:38,408
- How's Fang?
- Off his food.

422
00:23:38,476 --> 00:23:40,408
Blimey, that bad?

423
00:23:40,476 --> 00:23:43,108
Now, be sure he gets
his ice cream every night.

424
00:23:43,177 --> 00:23:46,808
Yes, I will, but he won't eat
it out of your spoon for me.

425
00:23:48,442 --> 00:23:50,808
And Big-Time is off air.

426
00:23:50,876 --> 00:23:53,240
We could go out of business.

427
00:23:53,309 --> 00:23:55,973
He likes chocolate chip best.

428
00:24:06,074 --> 00:24:07,506
If they are zipping, Theora,

429
00:24:07,575 --> 00:24:09,573
they're very
clever at hiding it.

430
00:24:09,642 --> 00:24:13,505
Apart from the
inside of locker doors,

431
00:24:13,574 --> 00:24:17,472
- whole place is clean.
- Oh, no, it isn't, Edison.

432
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:22,005
That hardware they've got in there
is fully capable of signal zipping.

433
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:25,671
Look.

434
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,271
Crafty little devils.

435
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:30,138
That's nothing to
the rest of the setup.

436
00:24:33,439 --> 00:24:36,538
Some have
perverted little minds.

437
00:24:38,972 --> 00:24:41,137
Oh, good, there's Bryce.

438
00:24:45,505 --> 00:24:49,636
Nice to see you accessing
the old memory bank, sir.

439
00:24:49,705 --> 00:24:52,381
Turn down the potentiometer
before you close the mic.

440
00:24:52,405 --> 00:24:55,868
I've come to say goodbye.
We're about finished here.

441
00:24:55,937 --> 00:24:57,602
Are your mics security looped?

442
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:59,602
- Of course.
- Good.

443
00:25:02,105 --> 00:25:04,535
Congratulations.
We got away with it.

444
00:25:04,604 --> 00:25:06,547
The only thing that can
happen to Blank Reg now

445
00:25:06,571 --> 00:25:08,402
is some temporary discomfort.

446
00:25:08,471 --> 00:25:10,734
They'll soon find out he
hasn't the power to zip

447
00:25:10,803 --> 00:25:14,635
and justice will compute.

448
00:25:14,703 --> 00:25:17,102
- Eventually.
- You little beast.

449
00:25:17,171 --> 00:25:19,902
Bryce. I don't believe it.

450
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:22,887
Lots of little girls' and
boys' tricks in the system.

451
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:28,567
What kind of games
did you play, Theora?

452
00:25:28,635 --> 00:25:31,367
Growing up games.
Doctors and nurses.

453
00:25:31,435 --> 00:25:34,901
Yeah, well, there's
nothing like a good physical.

454
00:25:34,969 --> 00:25:37,233
Okay, turn left and
go straight ahead

455
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:38,911
until you reach the stairwell.

456
00:25:38,935 --> 00:25:42,400
Learn anything that
might brighten my day?

457
00:25:42,469 --> 00:25:45,433
Yes, I was quite fast.

458
00:25:45,501 --> 00:25:47,277
At the top of the
stairs, turn left

459
00:25:47,301 --> 00:25:48,599
and then down the hall.

460
00:25:48,668 --> 00:25:51,333
Ah. I must remember to
try and catch up with you.

461
00:25:51,401 --> 00:25:54,499
- As a specialist?
- But of course.

462
00:25:54,568 --> 00:25:57,232
Now I want you to lift
the nose of the statue.

463
00:26:00,234 --> 00:26:01,234
Pardon?

464
00:26:01,267 --> 00:26:02,498
You lift the nose,

465
00:26:02,567 --> 00:26:03,498
you flip the switch,

466
00:26:03,567 --> 00:26:06,531
and the door behind
the statue opens.

467
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,832
I'm afraid Bryce has
been a very naughty boy.

468
00:26:12,733 --> 00:26:15,064
I wonder what you
tweak to close it.

469
00:26:26,332 --> 00:26:29,896
Well, Bryce, I wondered
what had happened to you.

470
00:26:29,965 --> 00:26:31,696
What you up to?

471
00:26:31,765 --> 00:26:33,696
Sneaking a smoke? Or...

472
00:26:33,765 --> 00:26:35,663
zipping a network?

473
00:26:35,731 --> 00:26:37,663
Edison, how did you get in here?

474
00:26:40,997 --> 00:26:43,296
I think we better
go have a little talk.

475
00:26:43,365 --> 00:26:46,629
Oh, and try and remember,

476
00:26:46,697 --> 00:26:49,829
I was a kid once too.

477
00:26:58,763 --> 00:27:00,373
I wish you hadn't
kept anything from me.

478
00:27:00,397 --> 00:27:02,295
- Like what?
- Your record.

479
00:27:02,363 --> 00:27:04,400
But he hasn't got a
record. He's a Blank.

480
00:27:04,462 --> 00:27:06,427
Previous criminal activities.

481
00:27:06,496 --> 00:27:08,494
They can't have any files on me.

482
00:27:08,563 --> 00:27:10,272
I've been off the
records for years.

483
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:13,494
The network police ran
a computer investigation.

484
00:27:13,563 --> 00:27:16,760
They say the probability is
you committed these crimes.

485
00:27:16,829 --> 00:27:18,359
Oh, probability.

486
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:19,626
Yes, Dominique.

487
00:27:19,695 --> 00:27:21,526
If the probability computes,

488
00:27:21,595 --> 00:27:23,693
and in cases where
there's no evidence,

489
00:27:23,762 --> 00:27:25,560
they work on the probability.

490
00:27:25,629 --> 00:27:28,826
Well, I expect it saves
everybody a lot of work.

491
00:27:30,328 --> 00:27:32,059
It's not gonna save you, Reg.

492
00:27:32,128 --> 00:27:33,326
You compute.

493
00:27:33,394 --> 00:27:36,425
And the punishment for
network program zipping

494
00:27:36,494 --> 00:27:39,692
is terminal.

495
00:27:48,393 --> 00:27:50,992
You put together pieces
of my sat cam sequence

496
00:27:51,061 --> 00:27:52,558
from the purge directory?

497
00:27:52,626 --> 00:27:54,569
Most of it. The
computer did the rest.

498
00:27:54,593 --> 00:27:56,957
Man. I gotta recode
that sat cam program

499
00:27:57,026 --> 00:27:59,184
to wipe out all the files
before dumping them.

500
00:28:01,493 --> 00:28:05,723
We saw how you altered the
target from ACS to Big-Time.

501
00:28:05,792 --> 00:28:08,024
Computer-enhanced files.

502
00:28:08,092 --> 00:28:09,723
Illegally obtained.

503
00:28:09,792 --> 00:28:11,501
You can't use that
against me, Edison.

504
00:28:11,525 --> 00:28:12,989
That's inadmissible evidence.

505
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:15,201
We don't want to use
anything against you, Bryce.

506
00:28:15,225 --> 00:28:19,856
- We want to help Reg. So should you.
- Why?

507
00:28:19,924 --> 00:28:22,889
Because you've put him
in very serious danger.

508
00:28:22,958 --> 00:28:24,356
Bryce, I'm getting angry.

509
00:28:24,425 --> 00:28:27,022
Then stop. It's
quite unnecessary.

510
00:28:27,091 --> 00:28:28,967
Blank Reg didn't zip
our transmissions, right?

511
00:28:28,991 --> 00:28:30,456
You know he didn't.

512
00:28:30,525 --> 00:28:32,301
Why did you do it?

513
00:28:32,325 --> 00:28:33,967
I mean, why Reg, of all people?

514
00:28:33,991 --> 00:28:37,754
I had to make a quick decision.

515
00:28:37,823 --> 00:28:39,599
I had to protect ACS, didn't I?

516
00:28:39,623 --> 00:28:42,088
I don't believe it. An emotion.

517
00:28:42,157 --> 00:28:43,721
A decision, Edison.

518
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:47,488
I simply selected the closest
option that would achieve that goal.

519
00:28:47,556 --> 00:28:51,187
Now, Blank Reg couldn't be
proven guilty. It's an optimum solution.

520
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:58,852
What about right and wrong?

521
00:29:00,522 --> 00:29:03,087
Non-empirical concepts.

522
00:29:03,155 --> 00:29:07,153
Don't you understand? The network court
wants to make an example of someone.

523
00:29:07,221 --> 00:29:09,185
And Reg is it.

524
00:29:10,422 --> 00:29:11,887
Network courts.

525
00:29:11,954 --> 00:29:13,553
Our courts.

526
00:29:13,622 --> 00:29:16,685
All we have to do is
rearrange the information.

527
00:29:16,754 --> 00:29:18,952
As long as no one
finds out about ACS.

528
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:26,552
Bryce, stop treating
people like machines.

529
00:29:26,621 --> 00:29:28,951
You can't rearrange
information which is evidence.

530
00:29:30,487 --> 00:29:31,684
Grow up.

531
00:29:37,054 --> 00:29:39,384
Okay, okay, so you were right.

532
00:29:39,452 --> 00:29:41,584
He is an obstinate little child.

533
00:29:41,653 --> 00:29:43,484
Where are you going, Edison?

534
00:29:43,553 --> 00:29:45,017
Cheviot's office.

535
00:29:45,086 --> 00:29:47,594
Maybe I can get him to fix
things with the network court.

536
00:29:47,618 --> 00:29:48,662
You're just like Bryce.

537
00:29:48,686 --> 00:29:50,129
- What?
- Fix things with the court.

538
00:29:50,153 --> 00:29:51,895
- I mean, what about Reg?
- I care about Reg.

539
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:55,183
What about justice? You don't
need to fix it. He didn't do it.

540
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:57,209
But how do we
prove he didn't do it?

541
00:30:00,418 --> 00:30:02,516
Bryce is right.

542
00:30:02,584 --> 00:30:04,683
We can't use the
information he accessed

543
00:30:04,751 --> 00:30:06,448
and we can't testify for Reg.

544
00:30:06,517 --> 00:30:10,415
As 23's employees, our evidence
is inadmissible in 23's court.

545
00:30:11,685 --> 00:30:15,049
Unless Bryce helps,

546
00:30:15,117 --> 00:30:17,015
Reg is in very real trouble.

547
00:30:17,084 --> 00:30:19,049
Well, I'm gonna go and see Reg.

548
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:20,481
I mean, there must be a way

549
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:22,848
of proving he's incapable
of zipping from Big-Time.

550
00:30:22,917 --> 00:30:25,281
If Bryce won't help, I will.

551
00:30:33,648 --> 00:30:35,591
Why are you smirking
at me like that?

552
00:30:35,615 --> 00:30:37,114
Me? Smirk?

553
00:30:37,183 --> 00:30:39,613
That's not in my
pro-pro-program.

554
00:30:39,682 --> 00:30:41,520
I thought you were on my side.

555
00:30:41,582 --> 00:30:45,647
It's not a ques-question
of sides anymore, Bryce.

556
00:30:45,715 --> 00:30:48,213
Ha ha. Except
for the right side.

557
00:30:48,282 --> 00:30:50,479
I'm uncharacteristically
confused.

558
00:30:50,548 --> 00:30:52,191
I'm used to logic, not opinion.

559
00:30:52,215 --> 00:30:55,313
The thing... The thing
is you're a bit like me.

560
00:30:55,381 --> 00:30:58,012
Ex-Except we've
got different bits.

561
00:30:58,081 --> 00:31:00,445
Sometimes I think I
could use some leg-legs,

562
00:31:00,514 --> 00:31:03,612
and right now I think you-you-you
could use some conscience.

563
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,545
Which file is it in?

564
00:31:05,614 --> 00:31:07,712
Think of yourself
as a human program

565
00:31:07,781 --> 00:31:10,378
and that bit of you has
developed a glitch-ch-ch.

566
00:31:10,447 --> 00:31:12,044
Developed a glitch.

567
00:31:12,112 --> 00:31:14,511
Everyone keeps
lecturing me these days.

568
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:18,245
That's why I'm just
talk-talk-t-talking to you

569
00:31:18,313 --> 00:31:21,877
about getting
Blank Reg released.

570
00:31:23,946 --> 00:31:26,210
I know.

571
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:30,410
Yes, sir. That's right, sir.
We dropped off three more.

572
00:31:30,479 --> 00:31:32,517
Leave the truck
around the loading dock.

573
00:31:33,479 --> 00:31:35,776
If you told your lawyer
about your criminal profile,

574
00:31:35,845 --> 00:31:38,277
she might have been better
prepared to defend you.

575
00:31:38,344 --> 00:31:40,809
I told you, Dom, I didn't know.

576
00:31:40,878 --> 00:31:43,942
How could you not know
you had a criminal profile?

577
00:31:44,011 --> 00:31:47,075
It's something called

578
00:31:47,144 --> 00:31:50,875
the Career Capability
Malfeasance Program.

579
00:31:50,945 --> 00:31:52,809
CPMP.

580
00:31:52,877 --> 00:31:56,375
It's the program that matches
Blanks with unassigned profiles.

581
00:31:56,443 --> 00:31:59,408
It compares the crime template
to the personality template.

582
00:31:59,477 --> 00:32:02,175
And if it matches,
you're assumed guilty.

583
00:32:02,244 --> 00:32:04,220
Criminals can blank
out their identities,

584
00:32:04,244 --> 00:32:06,353
but they can't get rid
of their criminal profile.

585
00:32:06,377 --> 00:32:09,175
Are you saying there
are more criminal profiles

586
00:32:09,244 --> 00:32:10,362
than there are criminals?

587
00:32:10,409 --> 00:32:11,774
Precisely.

588
00:32:11,843 --> 00:32:13,002
If a Blank is arrested now,

589
00:32:13,042 --> 00:32:15,173
they run a CPMP on him.

590
00:32:15,242 --> 00:32:17,884
If the computer says the
probability is high enough,

591
00:32:17,908 --> 00:32:19,341
it's considered a match.

592
00:32:19,409 --> 00:32:21,440
So that isn't
really your profile.

593
00:32:21,508 --> 00:32:25,141
That's what I've been trying
to tell you. Blimey, Dom.

594
00:32:25,209 --> 00:32:27,906
Isn't science wonderful?

595
00:32:27,975 --> 00:32:31,807
- Oh, Reg.
- Yeah, wonderfully inhuman.

596
00:32:31,874 --> 00:32:33,173
I'm gonna go to 23.

597
00:32:33,241 --> 00:32:35,317
Our only chance is to
get Murray to authorize

598
00:32:35,341 --> 00:32:37,373
this as a story.

599
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,884
Template matching isn't justice.

600
00:32:38,908 --> 00:32:41,539
It's just administrative
convenience.

601
00:32:41,607 --> 00:32:44,806
Administrators. Button pushers.

602
00:32:44,874 --> 00:32:47,406
Hold on, Reg.

603
00:32:47,474 --> 00:32:51,772
As they say, the last resort of
the innocent is always publicity.

604
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:05,771
Watch me.

605
00:33:08,173 --> 00:33:09,870
Nicholas.

606
00:33:09,939 --> 00:33:12,703
We need a real-time conference.

607
00:33:12,772 --> 00:33:15,636
What's tickling your synapses?

608
00:33:15,705 --> 00:33:19,470
Now look. In my day, zipping
used to be a good hack.

609
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:20,703
But things have changed.

610
00:33:20,772 --> 00:33:23,270
It's a criminal offense now.

611
00:33:23,338 --> 00:33:24,802
And by trying to protect you

612
00:33:24,871 --> 00:33:28,969
and ACS, I'm in conflict
with my own network.

613
00:33:29,038 --> 00:33:30,603
So?

614
00:33:30,671 --> 00:33:33,403
So flatline the project

615
00:33:33,471 --> 00:33:35,080
and submit a
report to your sysop.

616
00:33:35,104 --> 00:33:37,601
That's not a winning option.

617
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:39,513
You're a minor. They
won't do anything to you.

618
00:33:39,537 --> 00:33:42,102
They'll dump me from
the Academy, Bryce.

619
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:44,168
Look, as long as
nobody says anything,

620
00:33:44,237 --> 00:33:45,868
nobody gets in trouble.

621
00:33:45,938 --> 00:33:47,501
Blank Reg does.

622
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:50,268
Who? That guy?

623
00:33:50,337 --> 00:33:51,568
He's just an old Blank.

624
00:33:51,635 --> 00:33:54,134
But he didn't do it.
We both know that.

625
00:33:54,203 --> 00:33:56,367
That's irrelevant.
Is this what happens

626
00:33:56,436 --> 00:33:58,645
when you have to work
around computer illiterates?

627
00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:01,700
You're really not compiling
this, are you, Nicholas?

628
00:34:01,769 --> 00:34:05,966
You did it. Blank
Reg didn't. Facts.

629
00:34:06,035 --> 00:34:09,466
Give me credit, Bryce.
I've got it all worked out.

630
00:34:09,535 --> 00:34:11,599
I'm sure your procedures
are impeccable.

631
00:34:11,668 --> 00:34:16,432
But you're using
the wrong formula.

632
00:34:18,668 --> 00:34:20,399
You remind me of myself.

633
00:34:20,468 --> 00:34:22,866
Should I take that
as a compliment?

634
00:34:26,301 --> 00:34:28,832
No.

635
00:34:33,833 --> 00:34:37,265
Calm down, Reg. I'm sure
Miss Keeler is on her way.

636
00:34:37,334 --> 00:34:39,798
If she's late for
my trial, I'll kill her.

637
00:34:41,167 --> 00:34:44,164
All homicide threats are
recorded for later playback.

638
00:34:49,666 --> 00:34:53,963
Stick that in your pipe
and smoke it, sunshine.

639
00:35:02,331 --> 00:35:03,830
Bryce.

640
00:35:03,898 --> 00:35:05,429
I'm at the Academy.

641
00:35:05,498 --> 00:35:08,795
I just had a real-time conference
with the zipping hacker.

642
00:35:08,864 --> 00:35:10,962
- Nicholas.
- That's wonderful.

643
00:35:11,031 --> 00:35:12,862
No, it's not.

644
00:35:12,931 --> 00:35:14,328
It didn't work.

645
00:35:14,397 --> 00:35:16,462
I don't know what to
do, Theora. Help me.

646
00:35:24,729 --> 00:35:26,461
What is it?

647
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:29,528
We just found out who
the guest prosecutor is.

648
00:35:29,596 --> 00:35:31,160
Paul Wade?

649
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:34,261
But he's the frontman for
23's<i> You the Jury</i> show.

650
00:35:34,329 --> 00:35:36,961
And the best television
prosecutor money can buy.

651
00:35:37,029 --> 00:35:40,294
It's a game show for my life.

652
00:35:45,328 --> 00:35:49,660
Welcome to Network 23's
award-winning game show

653
00:35:49,729 --> 00:35:53,960
<i>You the Jury.</i>

654
00:35:57,561 --> 00:35:59,492
This is the defendant,

655
00:35:59,561 --> 00:36:01,726
Blank Reg, a pirate TV operator

656
00:36:01,795 --> 00:36:03,571
employed by Big-Time Television,

657
00:36:03,595 --> 00:36:08,458
who Network 23 has charged
with first-degree signal zipping.

658
00:36:08,527 --> 00:36:12,192
These are the Metrocops who
claim they caught Blank Reg in the act.

659
00:36:12,261 --> 00:36:15,624
And this is the TV pirate's
attorney, Shelley Keeler.

660
00:36:15,693 --> 00:36:17,636
Shelley's got her
work cut out for her,

661
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:19,336
because today's guest prosecutor

662
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:22,658
is the Channel of Fortune's
leading quiz master,

663
00:36:22,726 --> 00:36:26,158
Paul Wade.

664
00:36:28,693 --> 00:36:33,056
On the show where the
audience decides the verdict,

665
00:36:33,125 --> 00:36:35,123
<i>You the Jury.</i>

666
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,435
We'll be back with our first
pleading in just a moment,

667
00:36:39,459 --> 00:36:41,957
but first, this word.

668
00:36:42,025 --> 00:36:44,322
If you want to do
justice to your cooking,

669
00:36:44,391 --> 00:36:46,789
try Zik-Zak Soy Muffin Mix.

670
00:36:46,858 --> 00:36:49,790
Tasteless, colorless,
and odorless.

671
00:36:49,859 --> 00:36:52,223
The perfect base
for every taste.

672
00:36:52,291 --> 00:36:55,055
Don't be guilty that
they have no taste.

673
00:36:55,124 --> 00:36:58,089
I know, Mr. Cheviot,
but Edison insisted.

674
00:37:00,491 --> 00:37:02,589
All right, Murray, put him on.

675
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:07,555
Yes, Carter.

676
00:37:07,624 --> 00:37:11,054
Your network court is on the
verge of convicting an innocent man.

677
00:37:11,123 --> 00:37:14,921
That's an awfully serious
charge. Can you back it up?

678
00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:17,353
I can.

679
00:37:17,422 --> 00:37:19,198
But I need you to buy
me a little more time.

680
00:37:19,222 --> 00:37:22,487
Are you asking me to subvert
the network's judicial process?

681
00:37:22,556 --> 00:37:25,554
Quite the contrary.

682
00:37:25,622 --> 00:37:29,020
I believe the true source of
the zipping is not Blank Reg,

683
00:37:29,089 --> 00:37:31,252
but the Academy of
Computer Sciences.

684
00:37:31,321 --> 00:37:33,086
For God's sake, Edison,

685
00:37:33,155 --> 00:37:35,897
those youngsters represent
the distillation of human intellect.

686
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:37,763
They're the root
stock of the future.

687
00:37:37,787 --> 00:37:39,598
Bryce Lynch is
the product of ACS.

688
00:37:39,622 --> 00:37:42,219
And Bryce is covering this
up by changing the coordinates

689
00:37:42,288 --> 00:37:44,130
away from the true
source of the zipping.

690
00:37:44,154 --> 00:37:47,886
If that's true, if our own head
of research and development

691
00:37:47,955 --> 00:37:49,530
is responsible for
covering up a crime

692
00:37:49,554 --> 00:37:52,463
which cost this network
hundreds of thousands of credits,

693
00:37:52,487 --> 00:37:54,818
we'll be the laughingstock
of the industry.

694
00:37:54,887 --> 00:37:56,863
We could lose the
entire Zik-Zak account.

695
00:37:56,887 --> 00:38:01,218
Mr. Cheviot, couldn't we
reschedule the network court?

696
00:38:01,286 --> 00:38:03,451
Give Edison some time
to clean up this mess.

697
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:07,551
Please. Sir, the
accused is Blank Reg.

698
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:10,117
I'm sorry about Blank
Reg, believe me.

699
00:38:10,186 --> 00:38:12,850
If he's innocent, I'm
sure he'll be acquitted.

700
00:38:12,919 --> 00:38:14,351
He's only one man.

701
00:38:14,419 --> 00:38:17,084
I have to concern myself
with the greatest good

702
00:38:17,153 --> 00:38:18,428
for the greatest
number of people.

703
00:38:18,452 --> 00:38:21,050
Which means this entire network.

704
00:38:21,118 --> 00:38:23,550
No, Murray. I won't reschedule.

705
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:32,516
Better find Bryce.

706
00:38:34,418 --> 00:38:36,416
It's time for kill or cure.

707
00:38:37,751 --> 00:38:39,915
Welcome back to<i> You the Jury.</i>

708
00:38:39,983 --> 00:38:42,782
And now, here's the judge.

709
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:49,147
Thank you. Hello, hello, hello.

710
00:38:49,216 --> 00:38:51,014
Oh, thank you, thank you.

711
00:38:51,082 --> 00:38:53,615
And welcome to the
show that puts you

712
00:38:53,684 --> 00:38:55,781
in the jury box.

713
00:38:55,849 --> 00:38:59,015
Our first case today
involves a charge of zipping

714
00:38:59,083 --> 00:39:00,847
against a Blank Reg.

715
00:39:00,916 --> 00:39:04,547
For 1,000 credits, how does
your client plead, Ms. Keeler?

716
00:39:04,616 --> 00:39:07,814
Innocent. I...

717
00:39:07,882 --> 00:39:09,414
I mean, not guilty, sir.

718
00:39:09,482 --> 00:39:12,480
Just relax, Ms. Keeler.

719
00:39:12,549 --> 00:39:15,379
Proceed with your opening
argument, Mr. Wade.

720
00:39:15,448 --> 00:39:16,780
Thanks, Bob.

721
00:39:16,849 --> 00:39:19,758
Ladies and gentlemen, the
prosecution intends to prove

722
00:39:19,782 --> 00:39:20,980
beyond a shadow of a doubt

723
00:39:21,047 --> 00:39:23,446
that the Blank known as Reg

724
00:39:23,515 --> 00:39:26,845
is guilty of network zipping.

725
00:39:26,914 --> 00:39:30,279
What we're really talking
about here is principle.

726
00:39:30,348 --> 00:39:32,945
What we're talking about
is a threat to television.

727
00:39:33,014 --> 00:39:34,579
To our lives.

728
00:39:34,647 --> 00:39:37,645
We are talking
about interruptioning.

729
00:39:37,714 --> 00:39:41,412
When decent, honest,
peaceful television-loving people

730
00:39:41,481 --> 00:39:44,811
cannot watch<i> Shoppin' Spree</i>
without these savage attacks

731
00:39:44,879 --> 00:39:46,544
on their viewing freedom,

732
00:39:46,613 --> 00:39:48,311
we have to ask this question.

733
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:50,045
Are we being too lenient?

734
00:39:50,113 --> 00:39:51,511
When our wives and daughters

735
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:54,177
cannot shop from their
own homes in peace,

736
00:39:54,246 --> 00:39:57,610
we must ask is consumerism
itself under attack?

737
00:40:18,911 --> 00:40:20,030
Credit for your thoughts.

738
00:40:21,577 --> 00:40:24,075
Save your money, Edison.

739
00:40:24,144 --> 00:40:25,608
You already know.

740
00:40:25,677 --> 00:40:27,642
I don't want to sound paranoid,

741
00:40:27,709 --> 00:40:29,808
but...

742
00:40:29,876 --> 00:40:31,808
I know this place is bugged.

743
00:40:39,109 --> 00:40:41,074
Now we're in a cone of silence.

744
00:40:41,142 --> 00:40:42,740
No one can eavesdrop.

745
00:40:45,142 --> 00:40:46,874
I tried to redirect Nicholas,

746
00:40:46,942 --> 00:40:49,941
but he's a poorly
designed system.

747
00:40:50,009 --> 00:40:51,607
What system?

748
00:40:51,676 --> 00:40:54,973
The system that allows him to
be better off by keeping quiet.

749
00:40:55,042 --> 00:40:58,006
I mean, what good is a system
if it doesn't work properly?

750
00:40:58,075 --> 00:41:00,273
I hate to be the one to
break this to you, Bryce,

751
00:41:00,342 --> 00:41:04,806
but life is more than just
interactive systems analysis.

752
00:41:04,874 --> 00:41:06,739
Not really.

753
00:41:06,808 --> 00:41:08,806
It's a matter of information.

754
00:41:08,875 --> 00:41:12,738
Once we understand and
collate our ideas, life will be

755
00:41:12,807 --> 00:41:14,138
much simpler, really.

756
00:41:14,207 --> 00:41:16,272
It's a matter of
number crunching.

757
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:18,605
It's not just more complicated.

758
00:41:18,674 --> 00:41:21,738
Look, life is based on
something more than just logic.

759
00:41:21,807 --> 00:41:25,571
It's based on...

760
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,770
feelings.

761
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:29,538
So everyone keeps telling me.

762
00:41:32,906 --> 00:41:35,138
Is it difficult to keep
your feelings at bay?

763
00:41:35,207 --> 00:41:37,971
Well, you can

764
00:41:38,038 --> 00:41:39,981
switch them off when
they become inconvenient.

765
00:41:40,005 --> 00:41:42,848
It's just that every time you do,
you become a byte less human.

766
00:41:42,872 --> 00:41:46,836
But what if a microchip
failed to work properly

767
00:41:46,905 --> 00:41:49,781
because it had to make a moral
decision every time it switched?

768
00:41:49,805 --> 00:41:51,636
Okay.

769
00:41:51,705 --> 00:41:54,169
And what if you created
an artificial intelligence

770
00:41:54,238 --> 00:41:57,469
and it wouldn't work because it
disagreed with your principles?

771
00:41:59,137 --> 00:42:02,636
Then you have a choice which is
not just a yes/no binary absolute.

772
00:42:02,704 --> 00:42:05,268
It's a question of conscience.

773
00:42:05,337 --> 00:42:06,669
Yeah.

774
00:42:06,738 --> 00:42:08,502
Conscience.

775
00:42:10,837 --> 00:42:11,968
Better work that one out.

776
00:42:14,437 --> 00:42:16,035
Look,

777
00:42:16,103 --> 00:42:18,612
I really enjoyed this little
chat, but I gotta get going.

778
00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:21,512
I gotta go watch a friend of mine
go down for something he didn't do.

779
00:42:21,536 --> 00:42:25,033
Well, at least you'll
understand that.

780
00:42:33,435 --> 00:42:37,001
So, my little ch-ch-chip
off the old mainframe,

781
00:42:37,069 --> 00:42:38,800
what are you going to do?

782
00:42:40,635 --> 00:42:42,499
Well,

783
00:42:42,568 --> 00:42:45,899
I think I need to rewrite
my own program.

784
00:42:45,968 --> 00:42:49,466
Okay. Now, moving on to our
second round of questioning.

785
00:42:50,767 --> 00:42:54,865
Oh, that's the
plea-bargaining buzzer.

786
00:42:54,934 --> 00:42:56,832
Approach the bench, guys.

787
00:43:03,167 --> 00:43:05,265
According to our
rolling audience poll,

788
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:09,430
the Blank Reg should be
reduced to random electrons

789
00:43:09,499 --> 00:43:12,331
by a margin of 9 to 1.

790
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,730
This is my first and
last offer, sweetheart.

791
00:43:14,799 --> 00:43:17,508
If the Blank cops to zipping,
I'll settle for life and a day.

792
00:43:17,532 --> 00:43:19,242
I have to confer with my client.

793
00:43:19,266 --> 00:43:21,264
Will she go for
the life and a day,

794
00:43:21,332 --> 00:43:23,263
or try to get the Blank free?

795
00:43:23,332 --> 00:43:26,463
Let's ask some of the folks
in the gallery what they think.

796
00:43:26,532 --> 00:43:29,296
- This is the deal.
- I understand the offer.

797
00:43:29,365 --> 00:43:30,641
If I confess to
something I didn't do,

798
00:43:30,665 --> 00:43:32,074
I go to prison for
the rest of me life.

799
00:43:32,098 --> 00:43:35,230
Stuff it. I'd make a
very bad prisoner.

800
00:43:35,298 --> 00:43:37,396
They used the phrase
random electrons.

801
00:43:37,465 --> 00:43:39,830
I can't spell that, either.

802
00:43:39,898 --> 00:43:41,495
It means no?

803
00:43:41,564 --> 00:43:43,962
Conference time's up.
Approach the bench.

804
00:43:44,031 --> 00:43:46,062
So, what'll it be, Shelley?

805
00:43:47,464 --> 00:43:49,761
We're gonna go for it.

806
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:52,661
Oh, they're gonna go for it.

807
00:44:02,330 --> 00:44:04,994
Nicholas. You've been cheating.

808
00:44:05,063 --> 00:44:06,094
Nice try.

809
00:44:06,163 --> 00:44:07,294
Cheating?

810
00:44:07,362 --> 00:44:08,894
Loading inaccurate information

811
00:44:08,962 --> 00:44:11,327
designed to crash
a logic program.

812
00:44:11,395 --> 00:44:14,060
And output bias to produce
selective information.

813
00:44:14,129 --> 00:44:17,093
And putting it
simply, Nick, lying.

814
00:44:17,162 --> 00:44:18,960
We couldn't.

815
00:44:20,461 --> 00:44:21,860
The coordinates are clear.

816
00:44:21,929 --> 00:44:25,559
It really was the Big-Time
bus the zipping came from.

817
00:44:25,628 --> 00:44:27,459
Blank Reg must be brilliant.

818
00:44:27,528 --> 00:44:30,426
And guilty.

819
00:44:30,495 --> 00:44:32,373
Hey, let's watch his sentencing.

820
00:44:34,395 --> 00:44:36,459
Blank Reg, eh?

821
00:44:36,527 --> 00:44:39,525
Fancy being able
to zip a live program.

822
00:44:39,594 --> 00:44:42,991
Bryce, you're making a
mistake in your old age.

823
00:44:43,059 --> 00:44:46,292
You can't tell one set of
coordinates from another.

824
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:48,758
I assumed you guys had learned
something since I was here,

825
00:44:48,827 --> 00:44:50,602
but it's evident
that your generation

826
00:44:50,626 --> 00:44:53,124
hasn't the skills nor
the system for zipping.

827
00:44:53,194 --> 00:44:55,032
What would you call this setup?

828
00:44:56,826 --> 00:44:58,691
Toys for Tots.

829
00:44:58,759 --> 00:45:01,123
You're taking credit
for Reg's achievement.

830
00:45:01,193 --> 00:45:04,023
You're obviously trying
to impress the girls.

831
00:45:04,092 --> 00:45:06,589
Say when, Mr. Lynch.

832
00:45:06,658 --> 00:45:08,267
Nicholas, you're
behaving emotionally.

833
00:45:08,291 --> 00:45:09,291
Shut up.

834
00:45:12,392 --> 00:45:14,724
You wouldn't dare.

835
00:45:14,792 --> 00:45:17,523
Jury find Blank...

836
00:45:30,658 --> 00:45:32,576
I move for dismissal.

837
00:45:32,625 --> 00:45:35,655
Hold it. Looks like we've
got a move for dismissal.

838
00:45:35,724 --> 00:45:38,555
- On what grounds, Ms. Keeler?
- Pure logic.

839
00:45:38,624 --> 00:45:43,154
My client, Blank Reg, couldn't possibly
have caused the zipping you just saw.

840
00:45:43,222 --> 00:45:44,755
He's here in the court.

841
00:45:49,855 --> 00:45:52,254
Oh.

842
00:45:52,323 --> 00:45:54,121
Dismissed.

843
00:46:07,854 --> 00:46:09,886
Oh, Dom, that's the first time

844
00:46:09,955 --> 00:46:11,697
you've ever had
your arms around me.

845
00:46:11,721 --> 00:46:13,985
Oh, Reggie, darling.

846
00:46:14,054 --> 00:46:16,485
Ugh, about your
personal hygiene.

847
00:46:16,554 --> 00:46:18,118
Oh.

848
00:46:22,921 --> 00:46:24,629
What made Bryce change his mind?

849
00:46:24,653 --> 00:46:26,651
He didn't. He adjusted
his parameters.

850
00:46:26,721 --> 00:46:29,251
Think it'll make him
any easier to work with?

851
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:34,851
Never. Con-Con-Converts
are the worst kind of bigots.

852
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:35,984
One of yours?

853
00:46:36,053 --> 00:46:37,684
One of my best.

854
00:46:48,619 --> 00:46:51,716
